# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading) information on clinical trials from public registers, and for aggregating and analysing this information; it can be used for the

- EU Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/)
- ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV" classic, https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/)
- ISRCTN (https://www.isrctn.com/) 
- EU Clinical Trials Information System ("CTIS", https://euclinicaltrials.eu/) `r emoji::emoji("bell")` see [example](#workflow-ctis-example)

The motivation is to investigate and understand trends in design and conduct of trials, their availability for patients and to facilitate using their detailed results for research and meta-analyses. `ctrdata` is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system, but other systems and tools can be used with the databases created with the package. This README was reviewed on 2023-07-14 for version 1.13.3.9000 (after change of CTGOV website).

## Main features

* Protocol- and results-related trial information is easily downloaded: Users define a query in a register's web interface and then enter the URL into `ctrdata` which retrieves in one go all trials found. Documents in registers on trials can also be downloaded. Personal annotations can be made to trials when downloading a query. Synonyms of an active substance can also be found.
* Downloaded trial information is transformed and stored in a collection of a document-centric database, for fast and offline access. Information from different registers can be accumalated in a single collection. Uses `DuckDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `RSQLite` or `MongoDB`, via R package `nodbi`: see section [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata) below. Re-run any previous query in a collection to retrieve and update trial records. 
* For analyses, convenience functions in `ctrdata` allow to identify unique (de-duplicated) trial records across registers, to merge and recode fields as well as to easily access deeply-nested fields. Analysis can be done with `R` or other systems, by accessing the structured information in the database. 

URLs of queries in the registers can be automatically copied to the clipboard (including for "CTIS", where the URL does not show the query), see [here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). 

Remember to respect the registers' terms and conditions (see `ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)`).

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within [R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install package `ctrdata`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package's dependencies (`nodbi`, `jsonlite`, `httr`, `curl`, `clipr`, `xml2`, `rvest`, `lubridate` and `stringi`).

### 2. Command line tools `perl`, `sed` and `php` (5.2 or higher)

These are required for `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`, the main function of package `ctrdata` (see [Example workflow](#example-workflow)), to work with the registers EUCTR, CTGOV, ISRCTN (but are not required to work with CTIS); the function also checks if the tools can be used.

- For MS Windows, install [`Cygwin`](https://cygwin.org/install.html): In `R`, run `ctrdata::installCygwinWindowsDoInstall()` for an automated minimal installation. Alternatively, manually install Cygwin with packages `perl`, `php-jsonc` and `php-simplexml` into `c:\cygwin`. The installation needs about 160 MB disk space.

- In macOS including 11 Big Sur, these are already installed; as alternative and `r emoji::emoji("bell")`for macOS 12 Monterey and above, [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) can be used: `brew install php`, which seems to include all `php` libraries required for `ctrdata`.

- In Linux, these are usually already installed; tools to install vary by distribution (e.g., `sudo apt install php-cli php-xml php-json`).

### 3. Script to automatically copy user's query from web browser

This is optional; it works with all registers supported by `ctrdata` but is recommended for CTIS because the URL in the web browser does not reflect the parameters the user specified for querying this register. 

In the web browser, install the [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), click on "New user script" and then on "Tools", then enter into "Import from URL" this URL: [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js) and last click on "Install". 

The browser extension can be disabled and enabled by the user. When enabled, the URLs to all user's queries in the registers are automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into the `queryterm=...` parameter of function `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`. 

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

The functions are listed in the approximate order of use in a user's workflow (in bold, main functions). See also the [package documentation overview](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/index.html). 

Function name | Function purpose
---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
`ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()`	| Open search pages of registers or execute search in web browser
`ctrFindActiveSubstanceSynonyms()` | Find synonyms and alternative names for an active substance
`ctrGetQueryUrl()`	| Import from clipboard the URL of a search in one of the registers
`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()` | **Retrieve (download) or update, and annotate, information on trials from a register and store in a collection in a database**
`dbQueryHistory()` | Show the history of queries that were downloaded into the collection
`dbFindIdsUniqueTrials()` | **Get the identifiers of de-duplicated trials in the collection**
`dbFindFields()` | Find names of variables (fields) in the collection
`dbGetFieldsIntoDf()` | **Create a data frame (or tibble) from trial records in the database with the specified fields**
`dfTrials2Long()` | Transform the data.frame from `dbGetFieldsIntoDf()` into a long name-value data.frame, including deeply nested fields
`dfName2Value()` | From a long name-value data.frame, extract values for variables (fields) of interest (e.g., endpoints)
`dfMergeVariablesRelevel()` | Merge variables into a new variable, optionally map values to a new set of levels
`installCygwinWindowsDoInstall()` | Convenience function to install a Cygwin environment (MS Windows only)


## Databases that can be used with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial information and stores it in a database collection, which has to be given as a connection object to parameter `con` for several `ctrdata` functions; this connection object is created in slightly different ways for the three supported database backends that can be used with `ctrdata` as shown in the table. For a speed comparison, see the [nodbi documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi#benchmark). 

Besides ctrdata functions below, any such a connection object can equally be used with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (last row in table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite` (see vignettes).

Purpose | Function call
-------------------- | --------------------
Create **SQLite** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **MongoDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **PostgreSQL** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"`
Create **DuckDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_duckdb(dbdir = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Use connection with `ctrdata` functions | `ctrdata::{ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, dbQueryHistory, dbFindIdsUniqueTrials, dbFindFields, dbGetFieldsIntoDf}(con = dbc, ...)`
Use connection with `nodbi` functions | e.g., `nodbi::docdb_query(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)`


## Vignettes

- [Install R package ctrdata](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_install.html)
- [Retrieve clinical trial information](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_retrieve.html)
- [Summarise and analyse clinical trial information](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html)

## Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate the trials' status of conduct.

* Attach package `ctrdata`:

```{r load_ctrdata}
library(ctrdata)
```

* See help to get started with `ctrdata`:
```{r help_package}
help("ctrdata-package")
```

* Information on trial registers that can be used with `ctrdata`:
```{r help_registers}
help("ctrdata-registers")
```

* Open registers' advanced search pages in browser:
```{r open_searchpages}
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

* Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

* When trials of interest are listed in browser, _copy the address from the browser's address bar to the clipboard_

* Search used in this example: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

* Get address from clipboard:
```{r get_clipboard}
q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

q
#                                                   query-term  query-register
# 1 query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed           EUCTR
```

`r emoji::emoji("bell")` Queries in the trial registers can automatically copied to the clipboard (including for "CTIS", where the URL does not show the query) using our solution [here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). 

* Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to database:
```{r get_url, include=FALSE}
q <- "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed"
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)
```

The database collection is specified first, using `nodbi` (see above for how to specify `PostgreSQL`, `RSQlite`, `DuckDB` or `MongoDB` as backend, see section [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata)); then, trial information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:

```{r load_euctr}
# Connect to (or newly create) an SQLite database
# that is stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "some_database_name.sqlite_file",
  collection = "some_collection_name"
)

# Retrieve trials from public register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# Checking helper binaries: . . done
# (1/3) Checking trials in EUCTR:
# Retrieved overview, multiple records of 88 trial(s) from 5 page(s) to be downloaded (estimate: 4.4 MB)
# Downloading trials...
# Note: register server cannot compress data, transfer takes longer, about 0.3s per trial
# Download status: 5 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 6.99 Mb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 339 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 339 records on 88 trial(s) 
# No history found in expected format.
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

Under the hood, scripts `euctr2json.sh` and `xml2json.php` (in `ctrdata/exec`) transform EUCTR plain text files and CTGOV as well as ISRCTN `XML` files to `ndjson` format, which is imported into the database collection.

* Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP). `ctrdata` functions return a data.frame (or a tibble, if package `tibble` is loaded).

```{r analyse_pips}
# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  fields = c(
    "a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan",
    "p_end_of_trial_status",
    "a2_eudract_number"
  ),
  con = db
)

# Find unique (deduplicated) trial identifiers for trials that have more than
# one record, for example for several EU Member States or in several registers:
uniqueids <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials(con = db)
# Searching for duplicate trials... 
#  - Getting all trial identifiers (may take some time), 347 found in collection
#  - Finding duplicates among registers' and sponsor ids...
#  - 256 EUCTR _id were not preferred EU Member State record for 91 trials
#  - Keeping 91 records from EUCTR
# = Returning keys (_id) of 91 records in collection "some_collection_name"

# Keep only unique / de-duplicated records:
result <- subset(
  result,
  subset = `_id` %in% uniqueids
)

# Tabulate the selected clinical trial information:
with(
  result,
  table(
    p_end_of_trial_status,
    a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
  )
)
#                           a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
# p_end_of_trial_status      FALSE TRUE
#   Completed                   46   20
#   GB - no longer in EU/EEA     1    1
#   Ongoing                      3    1
#   Prematurely Ended            2    2
#   Restarted                    0    1
#   Temporarily Halted           1    1
```

* Add records from another register (CTGOV) into the same collection

* Search used in this example: https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug

```{r load_ctgov}
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug",
  register = "CTGOV",
  con = db
)
# 
```

* Add records from a third register (ISRCTN) into the same collection

* Search used in this example: https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma

```{r load_isrctn}
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma",
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from CTGOV: cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
# Checking helper binaries: done
# (1/3) Checking trials in CTGOV:
# Retrieved overview, records of 55 trial(s) are to be downloaded (estimate: 0.44 MB)
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 754.96 Kb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 55 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 55 trial(s)                
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

<div id="workflow-ctis-example"></div>
* Add records from a fourth register (CTIS `r emoji::emoji("bell")`) into the same collection

Queries in the CTIS search interface can be automatically copied to the clipboard so that a user can paste them into `queryterm`, see [here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). As of June 2023, more than 200 trials are publicly accessible in CTIS. See [below](documents-example) for how to download documents from CTIS. 

```{r load_ctis}
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://euclinicaltrials.eu/app/#/search?ageGroupCode=2",
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from CTIS: ageGroupCode=2
# (1/5) Downloading trials list, found 25 trials

* Result-related trial information

Analyse some simple result details (see this [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html) for more examples):

## Additional features under consideration

* Retrieve previous versions of protocol- or results-related information. The challenge is that, apparently, initial versions cannot be queried and historical versions can only be retrieved one-by-one and not in structured format.

* Merge results-related fields retrieved from different registers (e.g., corresponding endpoints). The challenge is the incomplete congruency and different structure of fields.

### Issues and notes

* Please file issues and bugs [here](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues). Also check out how to handle some of the closed issues, e.g. on [C stack usage too close to the limit](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22) and on a [SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/19#issuecomment-820127139)

* Information in trial registers may not be fully correct; see for example [this publication on CTGOV](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1452).

* No attempts were made to harmonise field names between registers (nevertheless, `dfMergeVariablesRelevel()` can be used to merge and map several variables / fields into one).
