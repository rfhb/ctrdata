# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading), aggregating and analysing clinical trials using information (structured protocol and result data, as well as documents) from public registers. It can be used with the

- EU Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/)
- EU Clinical Trials Information System ("CTIS", https://euclinicaltrials.eu/, see [example](#workflow-ctis-example))
- ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV2", see [example](#workflow-ctgov-example))
- ISRCTN Registry (https://www.isrctn.com/) 

The motivation is to investigate the design and conduct of trials of interest, to describe their trends and availability for patients and to facilitate using their detailed results for research and meta-analyses. `ctrdata` is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system, but other systems and tools can use the databases created with this package. This README was reviewed on 2025-07-20 for version 1.23.0.9000.

## Main features

* Protocol- and results-related trial information is easily downloaded: Users define a query in a register's web interface, then copy the URL and enter it into `ctrdata` which retrieves in one go all trials found. A [script](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser) can automate copying the query URL from all registers. Personal annotations can be made when downloading trials. Also, [trial documents](#documents-example) and [historic versions](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#historic-versions-of-trial-records-and-changes-in-sample-sizes) as available in registers on trials can be downloaded. 

* Downloaded trial information is transformed and stored in a collection of a document-centric database, for fast and offline access. Information from different registers can be accumulated in a single collection. Uses `DuckDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `RSQLite` or `MongoDB`, via R package `nodbi`: see section [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata) below. Interactively browse through trial structure and data. Easily re-run any previous query in a collection to retrieve and update trial records. 

* For analyses, convenience functions in `ctrdata` implement canonical [trial concepts](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrdata-trial-concepts.html) to simplify analyses across registers `r emoji::emoji("bell")`, allow find synonyms of an active substance, identify unique (de-duplicated) trial records across all registers, to merge and recode fields as well as to easily access deeply-nested fields. Analysis can be done with `R` (see [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html)) or other systems, using the `JSON`-[structured information in the database](#trial-records-in-databases). 

Remember to respect the registers' terms and conditions (see `ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)`).

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within [R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install package `ctrdata`:

```{r install_ctrdata, eval=FALSE}
# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package's dependencies (`jsonlite`, `httr2`, `xml2`, `nodbi`, `stringi`, `lubridate`, `jqr`, `dplyr`, `zip`, `readr`, `rlang`, `htmlwidgets`, `stringdist` and `V8`).

### 2. Script to automatically copy user's query from web browser

Optional; works with all registers supported by `ctrdata` and is recommended for CTIS so that its URL in the web browser reflects the user's parameters for querying this register. 

In the web browser, install the [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), click on "New user script" and then on "Tools", enter into "Import from URL" this URL: [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js) and then click on "Install". 

The browser extension can be disabled and enabled by the user. When enabled, the URLs to all user's queries in the registers are automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into the `queryterm = ...` parameter of function [ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrLoadQueryIntoDb.html). 

Additionally, this script retrieves results for `CTIS` when opening search URLs such as [`https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria={"status":[3,4]}`](<https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria={"status":[3,4]}>). After changing the URL in the browser, a "Reload page" is needed to conduct the search and show results.

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

The functions are listed in the approximate order of use in a user's workflow (in bold, main functions). See also the [package documentation overview](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/index.html). 

Function name | Function purpose
---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
`ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()`	| Open search pages of registers or execute search in web browser
`ctrFindActiveSubstanceSynonyms()` | Find synonyms and alternative names for an active substance
`ctrGenerateQueries()`	| `r emoji::emoji("bell")` **From simple user parameters, generates queries for each register to find trials of interest**
`ctrGetQueryUrl()`	| Import from clipboard the URL of a search in one of the registers
`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()` | **Retrieve (download) or update, and annotate, information on trials from a register and store in a collection in a database**
`ctrShowOneTrial()` | `r emoji::emoji("bell")` Show full structure and all data of a trial, interactively select fields of interest for `dbGetFieldsIntoDf()`
`dbQueryHistory()` | Show the history of queries that were downloaded into the collection
`dbFindIdsUniqueTrials()` | Get the identifiers of de-duplicated trials in the collection
`dbFindFields()` | Find names of variables (fields) in the collection
`dbGetFieldsIntoDf()` | **Create a data frame (or tibble) from trial records in the database with the specified fields**, `r emoji::emoji("bell")` see [trial concepts](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrdata-trial-concepts.html) for calculating concepts across registers
`dfTrials2Long()` | Transform the data.frame from `dbGetFieldsIntoDf()` into a long name-value data.frame, including deeply nested fields
`dfName2Value()` | From a long name-value data.frame, extract values for variables (fields) of interest (e.g., endpoints)
`dfMergeVariablesRelevel()` | Merge variables into a new variable, optionally map values to a new set of levels


## Databases for use with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial information and stores it in a database collection, which has to be given as a connection object to parameter `con` for several `ctrdata` functions. This connection object is created almost identically for the four database backends supported by `ctrdata`, as shown in the table. For a speed comparison, see the [nodbi documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi#benchmark). 

Besides `ctrdata` functions below, such a connection object can be used with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (see last row in table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite` (see vignettes).

Purpose | Function call
-------------------- | --------------------
Create **SQLite** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **DuckDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_duckdb(dbdir = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **MongoDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **PostgreSQL** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"`
Use connection with `ctrdata` functions | `ctrdata::{ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, dbQueryHistory, dbFindIdsUniqueTrials, dbFindFields, dbGetFieldsIntoDf}(con = dbc, ...)`
Use connection with `nodbi` functions | e.g., `nodbi::docdb_query(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)`

## Data model of `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` uses the data models that are implicit in data as retrieved from the different registers. No mapping is provided for any register's data model to a putative target data model. The reasons include that registers' data models are continually evolving over time, that only few data fields have similar values and meaning between registers, and that the retrieved public data may not correspond to the registers' internal data model. The structure of data for a specific trial can interactively be inspected and searched using function, see the section [below](#workflow-data-model). 

Thus, the handling of data from different models of registers is to be done at the time of analysis. This approach allows a high level of flexibility, transparency and reproducibility. To support analyses, `ctrdata` (from version 1.21.0) provides functions that calculate concepts of clinical trials across registers, which are commonly used in analyses, such as start dates, age groups and statistical tests of results. See [help(ctrdata-trial-concepts)](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrdata-trial-concepts.html) and the section [Analysis across trials](#workflow-across-registers-example) in the example workflow below. For further analyses, see examples of function [dfMergeVariablesRelevel()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dfMergeVariablesRelevel.html) on how to align related fields from different registers for a joint analysis. 

In any of the [databases](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/index.html#databases-for-use-with-ctrdata), one clinical trial is one document, corresponding to one row in a `SQLite`, `PostgreSQL` or `DuckDB` table, and to one document in a `MongoDB` collection. These `NoSQL` backends allow documents to have different structures, which is used here to accommodate the different models of data retrieved from the registers. Package `ctrdata` stores in every such document: 

- field `_id` with the trial identification as provided by the register from which it was retrieved
- field `ctrname` with the name of the register (`EUCTR`, `CTGOV`, `CTGOV2`, `ISRCTN`, `CTIS`) from which that trial was retrieved
- field `record_last_import` with the date and time when that document was last updated using `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`
- only for `CTGOV2` and `CTIS`: object `history` with a historic version of the trial and with `history_version`, which contains the fields `version_number` (starting from 1) and `version_date`
- all original fields as provided by the register for that trial (see example in [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#historic-versions-of-trial-records-and-changes-in-sample-sizes))

For visualising the data structure for a trial, see this 
[vignette section](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#analysing-nested-fields-such-as-trial-results).

## Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate the trials' status of conduct.

* Attach package `ctrdata`:
```{r load_ctrdata}
library(ctrdata)
```

* See help to get started with `ctrdata`:
```{r help_package}
help("ctrdata")
```

* Information on trial registers, their contents and how they can be used with `ctrdata` (last updated 2025-05-31):
```{r help_registers}
help("ctrdata-registers")
```

* Trial concepts across registers provided by `ctrdata` (new 2025-03-09 `r emoji::emoji("bell")`):
```{r help_trial_concepts}
help("ctrdata-trial-concepts")
```

* Open registers' advanced search pages in browser:
```{r open_searchpages}
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

* Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

* When trials of interest are listed in browser, _copy the address from the browser's address bar to the clipboard_ (you can automate this, see [here](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser))

* Search used in this example: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children

* Get address from clipboard:
```{r get_clipboard}
q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/
# ctr-search/search?query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children

q
#  query-term query-register
# 1 query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children          EUCTR
```

`r emoji::emoji("bell")` Queries in the trial registers can automatically copied to the clipboard (including for "CTIS", where the URL otherwise does not show the user's query) using the solution [here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). 

* Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to database:

```{r get_url, include=FALSE}
q <- "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children"
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)
```

For loading the trial information, first a database collection is specified, using `nodbi` (see above for how to specify `PostgreSQL`, `RSQlite`, `DuckDB` or `MongoDB` as backend, see section [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata)): 

```{r create_db}
# Connect to (or create) an SQLite database
# stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "database_name.sql",
  collection = "collection_name"
)
```

Then, the trial information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:

```{r load_euctr}
# Retrieve trials from public register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  euctrresults = TRUE,
  euctrprotocolsall = FALSE, # new since 2025-07-20, loads single 
  # instead of all available country versions of a trial in EUCTR
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children
# * Checking trials in EUCTR, found 73 trials 
# - Downloading in 4 batch(es) (20 trials each; estimate: 9 MB)
# - Downloading 73 records of 73 trials (estimate: 4 s)               
# - Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 0.2 s) . .                          
# - Importing records into database...
# = Imported or updated 73 records on 73 trial(s)  
# * Checking results if available from EUCTR for 73 trials: 
# - Downloading results...
# - Extracting results (. = data, F = file[s] and data, x = none): . . . F . . . 
# F . . F . . . . . . . F . F F . . . . . . F . . . . 
# - Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 3 s)...
# - Importing results into database (may take some time)...
# - Results history: not retrieved (euctrresultshistory = FALSE)
# = Imported or updated results for 33 trials
# No history found in expected format.
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 73
```

Under the hood, EUCTR plain text and XML files from EUCTR, CTGOV, ISRCTN are converted using Javascript via `V8` in `R` into `NDJSON`, which is imported into the database collection.

* Easily generate queries for each register and add records from several registers into the same collection

The same parameters can be used to ask `ctrdata` to generate search queries that apply to each register, for opening the web interfaces and for loading the trial data into the collection:

```{r load_trials}
# Generate queries for each register
queries <- ctrGenerateQueries(
  condition = "neuroblastoma",
  recruitment = "completed",
  phase = "phase 2",
  population = "P"
)

queries
# EUCTR "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=
#neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children&age=adolescent&age=infant-and-
#toddler&age=newborn&age=preterm-new-born-infants&age=under-18&status=completed" 
#

# 
# CTIS "https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria=
#{\"medicalCondition\":\"neuroblastoma\",\"trialPhaseCode\":[4],
#\"ageGroupCode\":[2],\"status\":[5,8]}"  

# Open queries in registers' web interfaces
sapply(queries, ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser)

# Load all queries into database collection
result <- lapply(queries, ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, con = db)

sapply(result, "[[", "n")
# EUCTR       ISRCTN       CTGOV2 CTGOV2expert         CTIS 
#   180            0          111          111            1
```

* Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP). `ctrdata` functions return a data.frame (or a tibble, if package `tibble` is loaded).

```{r analyse_pips}
# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  # Field of interest
  fields = c("a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan"),
  # Trial concepts calculated across registers
  calculate = c("f.statusRecruitment", "f.isUniqueTrial"),
  con = db
)
# To review trial concepts details, call 'help("ctrdata-trial-concepts")'

* Queries to CTGOV and CTGOV2

The new website and API introduced in July 2023 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) is supported by `ctrdata` since mid-2023 and identified in `ctrdata` as `CTGOV2`. 

On 2024-06-25, `CTGOV` has retired the classic website and API used by `ctrdata` since 2015. To support users, `ctrdata` automatically translates and redirects queries to the current website. This helps with automatically updating previously loaded queries (`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(querytoupdate = <n>)`), manually migrating queries and reproducible work on clinical trials information. Going forward, users are recommended to change to use `CTGOV2` queries. 

As regards study data, important differences exist between field names and contents of information retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`; see the [schema for study protocols in `CTGOV`](https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/documents/xsd/prs/ProtocolRecordSchema.xsd), the [schema for study results](https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/documents/xsd/prs/RRSUploadSchema.xsd) and the [Study Data Structure for `CTGOV2`](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/about-api/study-data-structure). For more details, call `help("ctrdata-registers")`. This is one of the reasons why `ctrdata` handles the situation as if these were two different registers and will continue to identify the current API as `register = "CTGOV2"`, to support the analysis stage. 

Note that loading trials with `ctrdata` overwrites the previous record with `CTGOV2` data, whether the previous record was retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2` queries. 

Example using a CTGOV query: 

```{r load_ctgov}
# CTGOV search query URL
q <- "https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug"

# Open old URL (CTGOV) in current website (CTGOV2):
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)
# Since 2024-06-25, the classic CTGOV servers are no longer available.
# Package ctrdata has translated the classic CTGOV query URL from this call
# of function ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(queryterm = ...) into a query URL that works
# with the current CTGOV2. This is printed below and is also part of the return
# value of this function, ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(...)$url. This URL can be used with
# ctrdata functions. Note that the fields and data schema of trials differ
# between CTGOV and CTGOV2.
#
# Replace this URL:
#
# https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=
#With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
#
# with this URL:
#
# https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=
#ages:child,results:with,status:com
#
# * Found search query from CTGOV2: cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=
#ages:child,results:with,status:com

# Count trials
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  con = db,
  only.count = TRUE
)
# $n
# [1] 71
```

Queries in the CTIS search interface can be automatically copied to the clipboard so that a user can paste them into `queryterm`, see [here](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). Subsequent to the relaunch of CTIS on 2024-07-18, there are more than 8,700 trials publicly accessible in CTIS. See [below](#documents-example) for how to download documents from CTIS. 

```{r load_ctis}
# See how many trials are in CTIS publicly accessible:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "",
  register = "CTIS",
  only.count = TRUE
)
# $n
# [1] 9582
```

* Inspect and search structure of trial information

For a given trial, function [ctrShowOneTrial()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrShowOneTrial.html) enables the user to visualise the hiearchy of fields and contents in the user's local web browser, to search for field names and field values, and to select and copy selected fields' names for use with function [dbGetFieldsIntoDf()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dbGetFieldsIntoDf.html). 

```{r inspect_trial}
# This opens a local browser for user interaction.
# If the trial identifier (_id) is not found in the specified 
# collection, it will be retrieved from the relevant register.
ctrShowOneTrial(
  identifier = "2024-518931-12-00",
  con = db
)
```

* Analysis across registers

Show cumulative start of trials over time. This uses the calculation of trial 
concepts as available since `ctrdata` version 1.21.0 `r emoji::emoji("bell")`.

```{r analyse_across_trials}
# use helper packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  calculate = c(
    "f.statusRecruitment", 
    "f.isUniqueTrial", 
    "f.startDate"),
  con = db
)
# To review trial concepts details, call 'help("ctrdata-trial-concepts")'
# Querying database (24 fields)...

result %>%
  filter(.isUniqueTrial) %>%
  ggplot() +

## Future features

* See project outline https://github.com/users/rfhb/projects/1

* Authentication, expected to be required by CTGOV2; specifications not yet known (work not yet started).

* Explore further registers (exploration is continually ongoing; added value, terms and conditions for programmatic access vary; no clear roadmap is established yet).

Implemented: 

* ~~Retrieve previous versions of protocol- or results-related information. The challenges include, historic versions can only be retrieved one-by-one, do not include results, or are not in structured format. The functionality available at this time, is to retrieve any version in CTGOV2, and to create a version when re-running a CTIS query and retrieving new data.~~

* ~~Canonical definitions, filters, calculations are in the works (since August 2023, released in version 1.20.0) for data mangling and analyses across registers, e.g. to define study population, identify interventional trials, calculate study duration; public collaboration on these canonical scripts will speed up harmonising analyses.~~ 

* ~~Merge results-related fields retrieved from different registers, such as corresponding endpoints. The challenge is the incomplete congruency and different structure of data fields. This has largely been implemented as per the previous bullet point.~~

## Issues and notes

* Information in trial registers may not be fully correct; see for example [this publication on CTGOV](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1452).

* A warning may be issued and a record not imported if the complexity of the XML content is too high for processing. The issue can be resolved by increasing in the operating system the stack size available to R, see: https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22

* Please file issues and bugs [here](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues). Also check out how to handle some of the closed issues, e.g. on [C stack usage too close to the limit](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22) and on a [SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/19#issuecomment-820127139).
