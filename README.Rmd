# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading), aggregating and analysing information on clinical trials from public registers. It can be used for the

- EU Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/)
- EU Clinical Trials Information System ("CTIS", https://euclinicaltrials.eu/, see [example](#workflow-ctis-example))
- ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV2", see [example](#workflow-ctgov-example))
- ISRCTN Registry (https://www.isrctn.com/) 

The motivation is to investigate and understand trends in design and conduct of trials, their availability for patients and to facilitate using their detailed results for research and meta-analyses. `ctrdata` is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system, but other systems and tools can be used with the databases created with the package. This README was reviewed on 2024-11-09 for version 1.19.4.9000.

## Main features

* Protocol- and results-related trial information is easily downloaded: Users define a query in a register's web interface, then copy the URL and enter it into `ctrdata` which retrieves in one go all trials found. A [script](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser) can automate copying the query URL from all registers. Personal annotations can be made when downloading trials. Also, [trial documents](#documents-example) and [historic versions](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#analysing-sample-size-using-historic-versions-of-trial-records) as available in registers on trials can be downloaded. 
* Downloaded trial information is transformed and stored in a collection of a document-centric database, for fast and offline access. Information from different registers can be accumulated in a single collection. Uses `DuckDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `RSQLite` or `MongoDB`, via R package `nodbi`: see section [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata) below. Easily re-run any previous query in a collection to retrieve and update trial records. 
* For analyses, convenience functions in `ctrdata` allow find synonyms of an active substance, to identify unique (de-duplicated) trial records across all registers, to merge and recode fields as well as to easily access deeply-nested fields. Analysis can be done with `R` (see [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html)) or other systems, using the `JSON`-[structured information in the database](#trial-records-in-databases).

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within [R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install package `ctrdata`:

```{r install_ctrdata, eval=FALSE}
# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package's dependencies (`jsonlite`, `httr`, `curl`, `clipr`, `xml2`, `nodbi`, `stringi`, `tibble`,  `lubridate`, `jqr`, `dplyr`, `zip` and `V8`).

### 2. Script to automatically copy user's query from web browser

This is optional; it works with all registers supported by `ctrdata` but is recommended for CTIS because the URL in the web browser does not reflect the parameters the user specified for querying this register. 

In the web browser, install the [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), click on "New user script" and then on "Tools", enter into "Import from URL" this URL: [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js) and then click on "Install". 

The browser extension can be disabled and enabled by the user. When enabled, the URLs to all user's queries in the registers are automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into the `queryterm = ...` parameter of function [ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrLoadQueryIntoDb.html). 

Additionally, this script retrieves results for `CTIS` search URLs such as [https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria={"status":[3,4]}](https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria={"status":[3,4]}). 

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

The functions are listed in the approximate order of use in a user's workflow (in bold, main functions). See also the [package documentation overview](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/index.html). 

Function name | Function purpose
---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
`ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()`	| Open search pages of registers or execute search in web browser
`ctrFindActiveSubstanceSynonyms()` | Find synonyms and alternative names for an active substance
`ctrGetQueryUrl()`	| Import from clipboard the URL of a search in one of the registers
`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()` | **Retrieve (download) or update, and annotate, information on trials from a register and store in a collection in a database**
`dbQueryHistory()` | Show the history of queries that were downloaded into the collection
`dbFindIdsUniqueTrials()` | **Get the identifiers of de-duplicated trials in the collection**
`dbFindFields()` | Find names of variables (fields) in the collection
`dbGetFieldsIntoDf()` | **Create a data frame (or tibble) from trial records in the database with the specified fields**
`dfTrials2Long()` | Transform the data.frame from `dbGetFieldsIntoDf()` into a long name-value data.frame, including deeply nested fields
`dfName2Value()` | From a long name-value data.frame, extract values for variables (fields) of interest (e.g., endpoints)
`dfMergeVariablesRelevel()` | Merge variables into a new variable, optionally map values to a new set of levels


## Databases for use with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial information and stores it in a database collection, which has to be given as a connection object to parameter `con` for several `ctrdata` functions; this connection object is created in slightly different ways for the four supported database backends that can be used with `ctrdata` as shown in the table. For a speed comparison, see the [nodbi documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi#benchmark). 

Besides ctrdata functions below, any such a connection object can equally be used with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (last row in table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite` (see vignettes).

Purpose | Function call
-------------------- | --------------------
Create **SQLite** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **MongoDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Create **PostgreSQL** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"`
Create **DuckDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_duckdb(dbdir = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`
Use connection with `ctrdata` functions | `ctrdata::{ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, dbQueryHistory, dbFindIdsUniqueTrials, dbFindFields, dbGetFieldsIntoDf}(con = dbc, ...)`
Use connection with `nodbi` functions | e.g., `nodbi::docdb_query(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)`

## Data model of `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` uses the data models that are implicit in data retrieved from the different registers. No mapping is provided for any register's data model to a putative target data model. The reasons include that registers' data models are notably evolving over time and that there are only few data fields with similar values and meaning between the registers. 

Thus, the handling of data from different models of registers is to be done at the time of analysis. This approach allows a high level of flexibility, transparency and reproducibility. See examples in the help text for function [dfMergeVariablesRelevel()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dfMergeVariablesRelevel.html) and section [Analysis across trials](#workflow-cross-trial-example) below for how to align related fields from different registers for a joint analysis. 

In any of the `NoSQL` [databases](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/index.html#databases-for-use-with-ctrdata), one clinical trial is one document, corresponding to one row in a `SQLite`, `PostgreSQL` or `DuckDB` table, and to one document in a `MongoDB` collection. The `NoSQL` backends allow documents to have different structures, which is used here to accommodate the different data models of registers. Package `ctrdata` stores in every such document: 

- field `_id` with the trial identification as provided by the register from which it was retrieved
- field `ctrname` with the name of the register (`EUCTR`, `CTGOV`, `CTGOV2`, `ISRCTN`, `CTIS`) from which that trial was retrieved
- field `record_last_import` with the date and time when that document was last updated using `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`
- only for `CTGOV2`: object `history` with a historic version of the trial and with `history_version`, which contains the fields `version_number` (starting from 1) and `version_date`
- all original fields as provided by the register for that trial (see examples [below](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/index.html#trial-records-json-in-databases))

For visualising the data structure for a trial, see this 
[vignette section](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#analysing-nested-fields-such-as-trial-results).

## Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate the trials' status of conduct.

* Attach package `ctrdata`:
```{r load_ctrdata}
library(ctrdata)
```

* See help to get started with `ctrdata`:
```{r help_package}
help("ctrdata")
```

* Information on trial registers and how they can be used with `ctrdata` (last updated 2024-06-23):
```{r help_registers}
help("ctrdata-registers")
```

* Open registers' advanced search pages in browser:
```{r open_searchpages}
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

* Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

* When trials of interest are listed in browser, _copy the address from the browser's address bar to the clipboard_ (you can automate this, see [here](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser))

* Search used in this example: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

* Get address from clipboard:
```{r get_clipboard}
q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL:
#  https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&
#  age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

q
#                                                   query-term  query-register
# 1 query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed           EUCTR
```

`r emoji::emoji("bell")` Queries in the trial registers can automatically copied to the clipboard (including for "CTIS", where the URL does not show the query) using our solution [here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). 

* Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to database:
```{r get_url, include=FALSE}
q <- paste0(
  "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?", "
  query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed")
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)
```

The database collection is specified first, using `nodbi` (see above for how to specify `PostgreSQL`, `RSQlite`, `DuckDB` or `MongoDB` as backend, see section [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata)). 

Then, trial information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:
```{r create_db}
# Connect to (or create) an SQLite database
# stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "some_database_name.sqlite_file",
  collection = "some_collection_name"
)
```

```{r load_euctr}
# Retrieve trials from public register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  euctrresults = TRUE,
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: 
#   query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Checking trials in EUCTR...

```

Under the hood, EUCTR plain text and XML files from EUCTR, CTGOV, ISRCTN are converted using Javascript via `V8` in `R` into `NDJSON`, which is imported into the database collection.

* Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP). `ctrdata` functions return a data.frame (or a tibble, if package `tibble` is loaded).

```{r analyse_pips}
# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  fields = c(
    "a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan",
    "p_end_of_trial_status",
    "a2_eudract_number"
  ),
  con = db
)

# Find unique (deduplicated) trial identifiers for trials that have more than
# one record, for example for several EU Member States or in several registers:
uniqueids <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials(con = db)
# Searching for duplicate trials... 
# - Getting all trial identifiers (may take some time), 452 found in collection
# - Finding duplicates among registers' and sponsor ids...
# - 342 EUCTR _id were not preferred EU Member State record for 110 trials
# - Keeping 110 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 records from EUCTR / CTGOV / CTGOV2 / ISRCTN / CTIS
# = Returning keys (_id) of 110 records in collection "some_collection_name"

# Keep only unique / de-duplicated records:
result <- subset(
  result,
  subset = `_id` %in% uniqueids
)

# Tabulate the selected clinical trial information:
with(
  result,
  table(
    p_end_of_trial_status,
    a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
  )
)
#      a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
# p_end_of_trial_status      FALSE TRUE
#   Completed                   52   24

```

* Add records from another register (CTGOV2) into the same collection

The new website and API introduced in July 2023 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) is supported by `ctrdata` since mid-2023 and identified in `ctrdata` as `CTGOV2`. 

On 2024-06-25, `CTGOV` has retired the classic website and API used by `ctrdata` since 2015. To support users, `ctrdata` automatically translates and redirects queries to the current website. This helps with automatically updating previously loaded queries (`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(querytoupdate = <n>)`), manually migrating queries and reproducible work on clinical trials information. Going forward, users are recommended to change to use `CTGOV2` queries. 

As regards study data, important differences exist between field names and contents of information retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`; see the [schema for study protocols in `CTGOV`](https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/documents/xsd/prs/ProtocolRecordSchema.xsd), the [schema for study results](https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/documents/xsd/prs/RRSUploadSchema.xsd) and the [Study Data Structure for `CTGOV2`](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/about-api/study-data-structure). For more details, call `help("ctrdata-registers")`. This is one of the reasons why `ctrdata` handles the situation as if these were two different registers and will continue to identify the current API as `register = "CTGOV2"`, to support the analysis stage. 

Note that loading trials with `ctrdata` overwrites the previous record with `CTGOV2` data, whether the previous record was retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2` queries. 

* Search used in this example: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int

```{r load_ctgov2}
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int",
  register = "CTGOV2",
  con = db
)
# * Appears specific for CTGOV REST API 2.0
# * Found search query from CTGOV2: cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int
# * Checking trials using CTGOV REST API 2.0, found 100 trials
# (1/3) Downloading in 1 batch(es) (max. 1000 trials each; estimate: 10 MB total)
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 9.19 Mb (805%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to NDJSON...
# (3/3) Importing records into database...
# JSON file #: 1 / 1                               
# = Imported or updated 100 trial(s)
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 100
```

* Using an example from classic CTGOV: 

```{r load_ctgov}
# Retrieve trials:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = paste0(
    "https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?", 
    "cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug"),
  con = db
)
# Appears specific for CTGOV Classic website
# Since 2024-06-25, the classic CTGOV servers are no longer available. 
# Package ctrdata has translated the classic CTGOV query URL from this call 
# of function ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(queryterm = ...) into a query URL that works 
# with the current CTGOV2. This is printed below and is also part of the return 
# value of this function, ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(...)$url. This URL can be used 
# with ctrdata functions. Note that the fields and data schema of trials differ 
# between CTGOV and CTGOV2. 
# 
# Replace this URL:
# 
# https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
# 
# with this URL:
# 
# https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,status:com
# 
# * Found search query from CTGOV2: cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=
# ages:child,results:with,status:com
# * Checking trials using CTGOV REST API 2.0, found 65 trials
# (1/3) Downloading in 1 batch(es) (max. 1000 trials each; estimate: 6.5 Mb total)
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 7.30 Mb (914%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to NDJSON...
# (3/3) Importing records into database...
# JSON file #: 1 / 1                               
# = Imported or updated 65 trial(s)
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 65
```

* Add records from a third register (ISRCTN) into the same collection

Search used in this example: https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma

```{r load_isrctn}
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma",
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from ISRCTN: q=neuroblastoma
# * Checking trials in ISRCTN...
# Retrieved overview, records of 12 trial(s) are to be downloaded (estimate: 0.2 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trial file... 
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 156.09 Kb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 0.07 s)...
# (3/3) Importing records into database...
# = Imported or updated 12 trial(s)                
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 12
```

<div id="workflow-ctis-example"></div>
* Add records from a fourth register (CTIS `r emoji::emoji("bell")`) into the same collection

Queries in the CTIS search interface can be automatically copied to the clipboard so that a user can paste them into `queryterm`, see [here](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). Subsequent to the relaunch of CTIS on 2024-07-18, there are more than 4700 trials publicly accessible in CTIS. See [below](#documents-example) for how to download documents from CTIS. 

```{r load_ctis}
# See how many trials are in CTIS publicly accessible:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "",
  register = "CTIS",
  only.count = TRUE
)
# $n
# [1] 6970

# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = paste0(
    'https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#', 
    'searchCriteria={"containAny":"neonate, neonates"}'),
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from CTIS: searchCriteria={"containAny":"neonate, neonates"}

## Future features

* See project outline https://github.com/users/rfhb/projects/1

* Canonical definitions, filters, calculations are in the works (since August 2023) for data mangling and analyses across registers, e.g. to define study population, identify interventional trials, calculate study duration; public collaboration on these canonical scripts will speed up harmonising analyses. 

* Merge results-related fields retrieved from different registers, such as corresponding endpoints (work not yet started). The challenge is the incomplete congruency and different structure of data fields.

* Authentication, expected to be required by CTGOV2; specifications not yet known (work not yet started).

* Explore further registers (exploration is continually ongoing; added value, terms and conditions for programmatic access vary; no clear roadmap is established yet).

* ~~Retrieve previous versions of protocol- or results-related information. The challenges include, historic versions can only be retrieved one-by-one, do not include results, or are not in structured format. The functionality available with version 1.17.3 to the extent that is possible at this time, namely for protocol- and results-related information in CTGOV2, only~~

### Issues and notes

* Please file issues and bugs [here](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues). Also check out how to handle some of the closed issues, e.g. on [C stack usage too close to the limit](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22) and on a [SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/19#issuecomment-820127139)

* Information in trial registers may not be fully correct; see for example [this publication on CTGOV](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1452).

* No attempts were made to harmonise field names between registers (nevertheless, `dfMergeVariablesRelevel()` can be used to merge and map several variables / fields into one).

## Trial records in databases

### SQLite

It is recommended to use nodbi >= 0.10.7.9000 which builds on RSQLite >= 2.3.7.9014 (releases expected in November 2024), because these versions enable file-based imports and thus are much faster:

```{r}
# install latest development versions:
devtools::install_github("ropensci/nodbi")

# requires compilation, for which under MS Windows
# automatically additional R Tools are installed:
devtools::install_github("r-dbi/RSQLite")
```
