# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading) information on clinical trials from public registers, and for aggregating and analysing such information. It can be used for the European Union Clinical Trials Register ("EUCTR", https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) and for ClinicalTrials.gov ("CTGOV", https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Development of `ctrdata` started mid 2015 and was motivated by the wish to understand trends in designs and conduct of trials and their availability for patients. The package is to be used within the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system. 

Last edit 2019-03-15 for version 0.15.9007, with bug fixes and new features: 

* dates are now returned as Date types, and some Yes / No fields are returned as logical, by function `dbGetFieldsIntoDf()`,  
* personal annotations can be added when records are retrieved from a register (new options `annotate.text` and `annotate.mode` for function `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`), for later use in analysis, and 
* synonyms of active substances to better find trials can be retrieved with function `ctrFindActiveSubstanceSynonyms()`. 

Main features:

* Protocol-related information on clinical trials is easily retrieved (downloaded) from public online sources: Users define a query using the registers' web pages interfaces and then use `ctrdata` for retrieving all trials resulting from the query. 

* Results-related information on these clinical trials is now included (since August 2017) when information is retrieved (downloaded). 

* Retrieved (downloaded) trial information is transformed and stored in a document-centric database (MongoDB), for fast and offline access. This can then be analysed with `R` (or others systems). Easily re-run a previous query to update a database collection.  

* Unique (de-duplicated) clinical trial records are identified (a database collection may hold information from more than one register, and trials may have more than one record in a register). `ctrdata` has also functions to merge protocol-related information from different registers and to recode it. Vignettes are provided to get started and with detailed examples such as analyses of time trends of details of clinical trial protocols. 

Remember to respect the registers' copyrights and terms and conditions (see `ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)`).

Package `ctrdata` has been used for example for: 

- Blog post on [Innovation coming to paediatric research](https://paediatricdata.eu/2018/01/14/innovation-coming-to-paediatric-research/)

- Report on [The impact of collaboration: The value of UK medical research to EU science and health](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/we-develop-policy/we-work-with-government/exiting-the-eu/uk-and-eu-research#downloads)

# Installation

## 1. Local [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/) (version 3) installation

Follow instructions for various operating systems [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). For macOS alternatively use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install mongodb`. From this installation, binaries `mongoimport{.exe}` and `mongo{.exe}` are needed. If the binaries are not on the system path under Unix, specify their folder as `ctrdata:::installMongoFindBinaries(mongoDirUnix = "<folder>")`.

## 2. Command line tools `perl`, `sed`, `cat` and `php` (5.2 or higher)

In Linux and macOS, these are usually already installed. For MS Windows, install [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html): In `R`, run `ctrdata::installCygwinWindowsDoInstall()` for an automated installation into `c:\cygwin`; alternatively manually install cygwin with packages `perl`, `php-jsonc` and `php-simplexml` (administrator credentials not needed). 

## 3. Within R

Within [R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to get and install the current development version of package `ctrdata` from github.com:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
#
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata")
#
# - In case of a problem with the SSL CA cert:
install.packages("httr")
httr::set_config(httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata")
# 
# - If not connecting, a proxy may need to be set:
install.packages("httr")
httr::set_config(httr::use_proxy("proxy.server.domain", 8080))
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata")
```

# Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate the trials' status. 

* Attach package `ctrdata`: 
```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ctrdata)
```

* Open registers' advanced search pages in browser: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()
#
# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

* Click search parameters and execute search in browser 

* Copy address from browser address bar to clipboard

* Get address from clipboard: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
q <- ctrGetQueryUrlFromBrowser()
# * Found search query from EUCTR.
q
#                                  query-term query-register
# 1 query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one          EUCTR
```

* Retrieve protocol-related information, transform, save to database and analyse:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Retrieve trials from public register
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(paste0("https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?", 
                          "query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one"))
#
# Alternative: ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(q)
#
# If no parameters are given for a database connection: mongodb is used
# on localhost, port 27017, database "users", collection "ctrdata". 
# Note: when run for first time, may download variety.js
#
# Under the hood, scripts `euctr2json.sh` and `xml2json.php` (in `ctrdata/exec`) 
# transform EUCTR plain text files and CTGOV xml files to json format.
#
# Get all records that have values in all specified fields.
# Note that b31_... is an element within the array b1_...
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(c("b1_sponsor.b31_and_b32_status_of_the_sponsor", 
                              "p_end_of_trial_status", "a2_eudract_number"))
#
# Eliminate trials records duplicated by EU member state: 
uniqueids <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials()
result    <- result[ result[["_id"]] %in% uniqueids, ]
#
# Tabulate the status of the clinical trial on the date of information retrieval
# Note some trials have more than one sponsor and values are concatenated with /.

# Issues and notes

* Please file issues and bugs here: [https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues). 

* Package `ctrdata` should work and was tested on Linux, Mac OS X and MS Windows systems. Linux and MS Windows are tested using continuous integration, see badges at the beginning of this document. Please file an issue for any problems. 

* The information in the registers may not be fully correct; see [this publication on CTGOV](https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k1452). 

* No attempts were made to harmonise field names between registers, but `dfMergeTwoVariablesRelevel()` can be used to merge and map two variables / fields into one. So far, there is no typing of database fields; they are all strings (except for indices).
