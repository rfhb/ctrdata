Description: Provides functions for querying, retrieving and analyzing
        protocol- and results-related information on clinical trials from
        two public registers, the 'European Union Clinical Trials Register'
        ('EUCTR', <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>), 
        'ClinicalTrials.gov' ('CTGOV', <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>) and
        the 'ISRCTN' (<http://www.isrctn.com/>). 
        Trial information is downloaded, converted and stored in a database 
        ('SQLite' or 'MongoDB', via 'nodbi'). 
        Functions are provided to identify de-duplicated records, 
        to easily find and extract variables (fields) of interest even 
        from complex nesting as used by the registers, and
        to update previous queries that users retrieved in a database. 
        The package can be used for meta analysis and trend-analysis of
        the design and conduct as well as results of clinical trials.
