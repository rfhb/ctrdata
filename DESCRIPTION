Description: Provides functions for querying, retrieving and analysing
        protocol- and results-related information on clinical trials from
        two public registers, the European Union Clinical Trials Register
        (EUCTR, <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>) and
        ClinicalTrials.gov (CTGOV, <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>). The
        information is transformed and then stored in a database (nodbi).
        Functions are provided for accessing and analysing the locally
        stored information on the clinical trials, as well as for
        identifying duplicate records. The package is motivated by the need
        for aggregating and trend-analysing the design, conduct and outcomes
        across clinical trials.
