Description: A system for querying, retrieving and analyzing
        protocol- and results-related information on clinical trials from
        three public registers, the 'European Union Clinical Trials Register'
        ('EUCTR', <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>), 
        'ClinicalTrials.gov' ('CTGOV', <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>) and
        the 'ISRCTN' (<http://www.isrctn.com/>). 
        Trial information is downloaded, converted and stored in a database 
        ('PostgreSQL', 'SQLite' or 'MongoDB'; via package 'nodbi'). 
        Functions are included to identify de-duplicated records, 
        to easily find and extract variables (fields) of interest even 
        from complex nesting as used by the registers, and
        to update previous queries. 
        The package can be used for meta-analysis and trend-analysis of
        the design and conduct as well as for results of clinical trials.
