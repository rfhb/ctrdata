# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading)
information on clinical trials from public registers, and for
aggregating and analysing this information; it can be used for the

-   EU Clinical Trials Register (‚ÄúEUCTR‚Äù,
    <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>)
-   ClinicalTrials.gov (‚ÄúCTGOV‚Äù, <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>)
-   ISRCTN (<https://www.isrctn.com/>) üîînew in v1.6.0

The motivation is to understand trends in design and conduct of trials,
their availability for patients and their detailled results. `ctrdata`
is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system, but other
systems and tools can be used with the databases created by it. This
README was reviewed on 2022-04-23 for v1.9.0.9000.

Main features:

-   Protocol-related trial information is easily retrieved (downloaded):
    Users define a query in a register‚Äôs web interface and then use
    `ctrdata` to retrieve in one step all trials resulting from the
    query. Results-related trial information and personal annotations
    can be including during retrieval. Synonyms of an active substance
    can also be found.

-   Retrieved (downloaded) trial information is transformed and stored
    in a document-centric database, for fast and offline access. Uses
    `PostgreSQL` (üîînew in v1.8.0.9000), `RSQLite` or `MongoDB` as
    databases, via R package `nodbi`: see section
    [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata) below. Easily
    re-run a previous query to update a database.

-   Analysis can be done with `R` (using `ctrdata` convenience
    functions) or others systems. Unique (de-duplicated) trial records
    are identified across registers. `ctrdata` can merge and recode
    information (fields) and also provides easy access even to
    deeply-nested fields (üîî new in v1.4.0).

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install
package `ctrdata`:

``` r
# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package dependencies, which are `nodbi`,
`jsonlite`, `httr`, `curl`, `clipr`, `xml2`, `rvest` and `stringi`.

### 2. Command line tools `perl`, `sed` and `php` (5.2 or higher)

These are required for `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`, the main function of
package `ctrdata` (see [Example workflow](#example-workflow)); the
function also checks if the tools can be used.

-   For MS Windows, install [`Cygwin`](https://cygwin.org/install.html):
    In `R`, run `ctrdata::installCygwinWindowsDoInstall()` for an
    automated minimal installation. Alternatively, manually install
    Cygwin with packages `perl`, `php-jsonc` and `php-simplexml` into
    `c:\cygwin`. The installation needs about 160 MB disk space; no
    administrator credentials needed.

-   In macOS including 11 Big Sur, these are already installed; as
    alternative and üîîfor macOS 12 Monterey,
    [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) can be used: `brew install php`,
    which seems to include the libraries required for `ctrdata`.

-   In Linux, these are usually already installed; tools for
    installation vary by distribution (e.g.,
    `sudo apt install php php-xml php-json`).

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

The functions are listed in the approximate order of use in a user‚Äôs
workflow (in bold, main functions).

If package `dplyr` is loaded, a tibble is returned instead of a
data.frame.

## Databases that can be used with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial information and stores it in a
database collection, which has to be given as a connection object to
parameter `con` for several `ctrdata` functions; this connection object
is created in slightly different ways for the three supported database
backends that can be used with `ctrdata` as shown in the table.

Besides ctrdata functions below, any such a connection object can
equally be used with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (last
row in table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite`
(see vignettes).

| Purpose                                 | Function call                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create SQLite database connection       | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`             |
| Create PostgreSQL database connection   | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"` |
| Create MongoDB database connection      | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                  |
| Use connection with `ctrdata` functions | `ctrdata::{ctr,db}*(con = dbc, ...)`                                                                         |
| Use connection with `nodbi` functions   | `nodbi::docdb_*(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)`                                                       |

## Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate
the trials‚Äô status of conduct.

-   Attach package `ctrdata`:

``` r
library(ctrdata)
```

-   See help to get started with `ctrdata`:

``` r
help("ctrdata-package")
```

-   Information on trial registers that can be used with `ctrdata`:

``` r
help("ctrdata-registers")
```

-   Open registers‚Äô advanced search pages in browser:

``` r
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

-   Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

-   When trials of interest are listed in browser, *copy the address
    from the browser‚Äôs address bar to the clipboard*

-   Search used in this example:
    <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed>

-   Get address from clipboard:

``` r
q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

q
#                                                   query-term  query-register
# 1 query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed           EUCTR
```

-   Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to
    database:

The database collection is specified first, using `nodbi` (see above for
how to specify `PostgreSQL`, `RSQlite` or `MongoDB` as backend); then,
trial information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:

``` r
# Connect to (or newly create) an SQLite database
# that is stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "some_database_name.sqlite_file",
  collection = "some_collection_name")

# See section Databases below
# for MongoDB as alternative

# Retrieve trials from public register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  con = db)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# (1/3) Checking trials in EUCTR:
# Retrieved overview, multiple records of 66 trial(s) from 4 page(s) to be downloaded
# Checking helper binaries: done
# Downloading trials (4 pages in parallel)...
# Note: register server cannot compress data, transfer takes longer, about 0.4s per trial
# Pages: 4 done, 0 ongoing
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 248 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 248 records on 66 trial(s)
# * Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

Under the hood, scripts `euctr2json.sh` and `xml2json.php` (in
`ctrdata/exec`) transform EUCTR plain text files and CTGOV as well as
ISRCTN `XML` files to `ndjson` format, which is imported into the
database collection.

-   Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric
development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP):

``` r
# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  fields = c(
    "a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan",
    "p_end_of_trial_status",
    "a2_eudract_number"),
  con = db)

# Find unique trial identifiers for trials that have nore than
# one record, for example for several EU Member States:
uniqueids <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials(con = db)
# Searching for duplicate trials...
#  - Getting trial ids, 279 found in collection
#  - Finding duplicates among registers' and sponsor ids...
#  - 208 EUCTR _id were not preferred EU Member State record for 71 trials
#  - Keeping 71 records from EUCTR
# = Returning keys (_id) of 71 records in collection "some_collection_name"

# Keep only unique / de-duplicated records:
result <- subset(
  result,
  subset = `_id` %in% uniqueids
)

# Tabulate the selected clinical trial information:
with(result,
     table(
       p_end_of_trial_status,
       a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan))
#                     a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
# p_end_of_trial_status      Information not present in EudraCT No Yes
#   Completed                                                 6 32  16
#   GB - no longer in EU/EEA                                  0  7   5
#   Ongoing                                                   0  1   0
#   Prematurely Ended                                         1  2   0
#   Restarted                                                 0  1   0
```

-   Add records from another register (CTGOV) into the same collection

-   Search used in this example:
    <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug",
  register = "CTGOV",
  con = db)
# * Found search query from CTGOV: cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
# (1/3) Checking trials in CTGOV:
# Retrieved overview, records of 44 trial(s) are to be downloaded
# Checking helper binaries: done
# Downloading: 620 kB
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 44 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 43 trial(s)
# * Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

-   Add records from a third register (ISRCTN) into the same collection

-   Search used in this example:
    <https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma",
  con = db)
# * Found search query from ISRCTN: q=neuroblastoma
# (1/3) Checking trials in ISRCTN:
# Retrieved overview, records of 9 trial(s) are to be downloaded
# Checking helper binaries: done
# Downloading: 90 kB
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 9 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 9 trial(s)
# * Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

-   Result-related trial information

Analyse some simple result details (see vignette for more examples):

``` r
# Get all records that have values in any of the specified fields
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  fields = c(
    "clinical_results.baseline.analyzed_list.analyzed.count_list.count",
    "clinical_results.baseline.group_list.group",
    "clinical_results.baseline.analyzed_list.analyzed.units",
    "study_design_info.allocation",
    "location"),
  con = db)

# Transform all fields into long name - value format
result <- dfTrials2Long(df = result)
# Total 6386 rows, 12 unique names of variables

# [1.] get counts of subjects for all arms into data frame
# This count is in the group where either its title or its
# description starts with "Total"
nsubj <- dfName2Value(
  df = result,
  valuename = "clinical_results.baseline.analyzed_list.analyzed.count_list.count.value",
  wherename = paste0(
    "clinical_results.baseline.group_list.group.title|",
    "clinical_results.baseline.group_list.group.description"),
  wherevalue = "^Total"
)

# [2.] count number of sites
nsite <- dfName2Value(
  df = result,
  # some ctgov records use
  # location.name, others use
  # location.facility.name
  valuename = "^location.*name$"
)
# count
nsite <- tapply(
  X = nsite[["value"]],
  INDEX = nsite[["_id"]],
  FUN = length,
  simplify = TRUE
)
nsite <- data.frame(
  "_id" = names(nsite),
  nsite,
  check.names = FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  row.names = NULL
)

# [3.] randomised?
ncon <- dfName2Value(
  df = result,
  valuename = "study_design_info.allocation"
)

# merge sets
nset <- merge(nsubj, nsite, by = "_id")
nset <- merge(nset, ncon, by = "_id")

# Example plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = nset) +
  labs(title = "Neuroblastoma trials with results",
       subtitle = "clinicaltrials.gov") +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = nsite,
      y = value.x,
      colour = value.y == "Randomized")) +

## Meta

### Additional features under consideration

-   Retrieve previous versions of protocol- or results-related
    information. The challenge is that, apparently, initial versions
    cannot be queried and historical versions can only be retrieved
    one-by-one and not in structured format.

-   Merge results-related fields retrieved from different registers
    (e.g., corresponding endpoints). The challenge is the incomplete
    congruency and different structure of fields.
