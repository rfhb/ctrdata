# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading)
information on clinical trials from public registers, and for
aggregating and analysing this information; it can be used for the

- EU Clinical Trials Register (‚ÄúEUCTR‚Äù,
  <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>)
- EU Clinical Trials Information System (‚ÄúCTIS‚Äù,
  <https://euclinicaltrials.eu/>, see [example](#workflow-ctis-example))
- ClinicalTrials.gov (‚ÄúCTGOV‚Äù classic and the 2023 ‚ÄúCTGOV2‚Äù, see
  [example](#workflow-ctgov-example))
- ISRCTN Registry (<https://www.isrctn.com/>)

The motivation is to investigate and understand trends in design and
conduct of trials, their availability for patients and to facilitate
using their detailed results for research and meta-analyses. `ctrdata`
is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system, but other
systems and tools can be used with the databases created with the
package. This README was reviewed on 2024-04-28 for version 1.17.2.9000
(major improvements: removed external dependencies; refactored
[`dbGetFieldsIntoDf()`](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dbGetFieldsIntoDf.html);
üîî retrieve historic CTGOV2 versions).

## Main features

- Protocol- and results-related trial information is easily downloaded:
  Users define a query in a register‚Äôs web interface, then copy the URL
  and enter it into `ctrdata` which retrieves in one go all trials
  found. A
  [script](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser)
  can automate copying the query URL from all registers. Personal
  annotations can be made when downloading trials. Also, [trial
  documents](#documents-example) and [historic versions]() available in
  registers on trials can be downloaded.
- Downloaded trial information is transformed and stored in a collection
  of a document-centric database, for fast and offline access.
  Information from different registers can be accumulated in a single
  collection. Uses `DuckDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `RSQLite` or `MongoDB`, via R
  package `nodbi`: see section
  [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata) below. Easily
  re-run any previous query in a collection to retrieve and update trial
  records.
- For analyses, convenience functions in `ctrdata` allow find synonyms
  of an active substance, to identify unique (de-duplicated) trial
  records across all registers, to merge and recode fields as well as to
  easily access deeply-nested fields. Analysis can be done with `R` (see
  [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html))
  or other systems, using the `JSON`-[structured information in the
  database](#mongodb).

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install
package `ctrdata`:

``` r
# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package‚Äôs dependencies (`jsonlite`,
`httr`, `curl`, `clipr`, `xml2`, `nodbi`, `stringi`, `tibble`,
`lubridate`, `jqr`, `dplyr`, `zip` and `V8`).

### 2. Script to automatically copy user‚Äôs query from web browser

This is optional; it works with all registers supported by `ctrdata` but
is recommended for CTIS because the URL in the web browser does not
reflect the parameters the user specified for querying this register.

In the web browser, install the [Tampermonkey browser
extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), click on ‚ÄúNew user script‚Äù
and then on ‚ÄúTools‚Äù, then enter into ‚ÄúImport from URL‚Äù this URL:
[`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js)
and last click on ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù.

The browser extension can be disabled and enabled by the user. When
enabled, the URLs to all user‚Äôs queries in the registers are
automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into the
`queryterm = ...` parameter of function
[ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrLoadQueryIntoDb.html)

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

## Databases for use with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial information and stores it in a
database collection, which has to be given as a connection object to
parameter `con` for several `ctrdata` functions; this connection object
is created in slightly different ways for the four supported database
backends that can be used with `ctrdata` as shown in the table. For a
speed comparison, see the [nodbi
documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi#benchmark).

Besides ctrdata functions below, any such a connection object can
equally be used with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (last
row in table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite`
(see vignettes).

| Purpose                                   | Function call                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create **SQLite** database connection     | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                        |
| Create **MongoDB** database connection    | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                             |
| Create **PostgreSQL** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"`            |
| Create **DuckDB** database connection     | `dbc <- nodbi::src_duckdb(dbdir = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                         |
| Use connection with `ctrdata` functions   | `ctrdata::{ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, dbQueryHistory, dbFindIdsUniqueTrials, dbFindFields, dbGetFieldsIntoDf}(con = dbc, ...)` |
| Use connection with `nodbi` functions     | e.g., `nodbi::docdb_query(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)`                                                        |

## Data model of `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` uses the data models that are implicit in data
retrieved from the different registers. No mapping is provided for any
register‚Äôs data model to a putative target data model. The reasons
include that registers‚Äô data models are notably evolving over time and
that there are only few data fields with similar values and meaning
between the registers.

Thus, the handling of data from different models of registers is to be
done at the time of analysis. This approach allows a high level of
flexibility, transparency and reproducibility. See examples in the help
text for function
[dfMergeVariablesRelevel()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dfMergeVariablesRelevel.html)
and section [Analysis across trials](#workflow-cross-trial-example)
below for how to align related fields from different registers for a
joint analysis.

In any of the `NoSQL`
[databases](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/index.html#databases-for-use-with-ctrdata),
one clinical trial is one document, corresponding to one row in a
`SQLite`, `PostgreSQL` or `DuckDB` table, and to one document in a
`MongoDB` collection. The `NoSQL` backends allow documents to have
different structures, which is used here to accommodate the different
data models of registers. Package `ctrdata` stores in every such
document:

- field `_id` with the trial identification as provided by the register
  from which it was retrieved
- field `ctrname` with the name of the register (`EUCTR`, `CTGOV`,
  `CTGOV2`, `ISRCTN`, `CTIS`) from which that trial was retrieved
- field `record_last_import` with the date and time when that document
  was last updated using `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`
- only for `CTGOV2`: object `history` with a historic version of the
  trial and with `history_version`, which contains the fields
  `version_number` (starting from 1) and `version_date`
- all original fields as provided by the register for that trial (see
  examples
  [below](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/index.html#trial-records-json-in-databases))

For visualising the data structure for a trial, see this [vignette
section](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#analysing-nested-fields-such-as-trial-results).

## Vignettes

- [Install R package
  ctrdata](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_install.html)
- [Retrieve clinical trial

## Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate
the trials‚Äô status of conduct.

- Attach package `ctrdata`:

``` r
library(ctrdata)
```

- See help to get started with `ctrdata`:

``` r
help("ctrdata")
```

- Information on trial registers that can be used with `ctrdata`:

``` r
help("ctrdata-registers")
```

- Open registers‚Äô advanced search pages in browser:

``` r
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

- Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

- When trials of interest are listed in browser, *copy the address from
  the browser‚Äôs address bar to the clipboard*

- Search used in this example:
  <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed>

- Get address from clipboard:

``` r
q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

q
#                                                   query-term  query-register
# 1 query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed           EUCTR
```

üîî Queries in the trial registers can automatically copied to the
clipboard (including for ‚ÄúCTIS‚Äù, where the URL does not show the query)
using our solution
[here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser).

- Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to database:

The database collection is specified first, using `nodbi` (see above for
how to specify `PostgreSQL`, `RSQlite`, `DuckDB` or `MongoDB` as
backend, see section
[Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata)); then, trial
information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:

``` r
# Connect to (or create) an SQLite database
# stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "some_database_name.sqlite_file",
  collection = "some_collection_name"
)

# Retrieve trials from public register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  euctrresults = TRUE,
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Checking trials in EUCTR...
# Retrieved overview, multiple records of 102 trial(s) from 6 page(s) to be downloaded (estimate: 10 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trials...

# Download status: 6 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 8.41 Mb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 2 s)...
# (3/3) Importing records into database...
# = Imported or updated 399 records on 102 trial(s)
# * Checking results if available from EUCTR for 102 trials: 
# (1/4) Downloading results...

# Download status: 26 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 104.66 Kb (100%)... done!             
# - extracting results (. = data, F = file[s] and data, x = none):
# F . F F . F . . F . . . F F . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . F . . . . . . F . . . 
# F . . . . . . . . . F . . . . F . . . . . F . . . . . . . . . . . 
# (2/4) Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 8 s)...
# (3/4) Importing results into database (may take some time)...
# (4/4) Results history: not retrieved (euctrresultshistory = FALSE)
# = Imported or updated results for 76 trials
# No history found in expected format.
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 399
```

Under the hood, EUCTR plain text and XML files from EUCTR, CTGOV, ISRCTN
are converted using Javascript via `V8` in `R` into `NDJSON`, which is
imported into the database collection.

- Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric
development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP). `ctrdata`
functions return a data.frame (or a tibble, if package `tibble` is
loaded).

``` r
# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  fields = c(
    "a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan",
    "p_end_of_trial_status",
    "a2_eudract_number"
  ),
  con = db
)

# Find unique (deduplicated) trial identifiers for trials that have more than
# one record, for example for several EU Member States or in several registers:
uniqueids <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials(con = db)
# Searching for duplicate trials... 
#  - Getting all trial identifiers (may take some time), 399 found in collection
#  - Finding duplicates among registers' and sponsor ids...
#  - 297 EUCTR _id were not preferred EU Member State record for 102 trials
#  - Keeping 102 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 records from EUCTR / CTGOV / CTGOV2 / ISRCTN / CTIS
# = Returning keys (_id) of 102 records in collection "some_collection_name"

# Keep only unique / de-duplicated records:
result <- subset(
  result,
  subset = `_id` %in% uniqueids
)

# Tabulate the selected clinical trial information:
with(
  result,
  table(
    p_end_of_trial_status,
    a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
  )
)
#                           a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan

- Add records from another register (CTGOV) into the same collection

Both the current and classic CTGOV website are supported by `ctrdata`
since 2023-08-05:

The new website and API introduced in July 2023
(<https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/>) is identified in `ctrdata` as
`CTGOV2`.

The website and API which is now called ‚Äúclassic‚Äù
(<https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/>) is identified in `ctrdata` as
`CTGOV`, and this is backwards-compatible with queries that were
previously retrieved with `ctrdata`. As long as the classic website is
available, `ctrdata` should work (it does not use the classic API,
announced to be retired in June 2024; it is unclear if and when the
classic website is retired).

Both use the same trial identifier (e.g., NCT01234567) for the same
trial. As a consequence, queries for the same trial retrieved using
`CTGOV` or `CTGOV2` overwrite any previous record for that trial,
whether loaded from `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`. Thus, only a single version
(the last retrieved) will be in the collection in the user‚Äôs database.

Important differences exist between field names and contents of
information retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`; see the [XML schemas
for `CTGOV`](https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/prs-xml-schemas.html)
and the [REST API for
`CTGOV2`](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api#extapi). For more
details, call `help("ctrdata-registers")`. This is one of the reasons
why `ctrdata` handles the situation as if these were two different
registers.

- Search used in this example:
  <https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int",
  register = "CTGOV2",
  con = db
)
# * Appears specific for CTGOV REST API 2.0
# * Found search query from CTGOV2: cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int
# * Checking trials using CTGOV REST API 2.0, found 99 trials
# (1/3) Downloading in 1 batch(es) (max. 1000 trials each; estimate: 9.9 MB total)
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 9.13 Mb (806%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to NDJSON...
# (3/3) Importing records into database...
# JSON file #: 1 / 1                               
# = Imported or updated 99 trial(s)
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 99
```

- Using an example from classic CTGOV:
  <https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug>

``` r
# Retrieve trials:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug",
  con = db
)
# * Appears specific for CTGOV Classic website
# * Found search query from CTGOV: cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
# * Checking trials using CTGOV Classic website...
# Retrieved overview, records of 62 trial(s) are to be downloaded (estimate: 0.5 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trial file...
# (2/3) Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 3 s)...
# (3/3) Importing records into database...
# = Imported or updated 62 trial(s)                
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 62
```

- Add records from a third register (ISRCTN) into the same collection

Search used in this example:
<https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma",
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from ISRCTN: q=neuroblastoma
# * Checking trials in ISRCTN...
# Retrieved overview, records of 9 trial(s) are to be downloaded (estimate: 0.2 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trial file...

- Add records from a fourth register (CTIS üîî) into the same collection

Queries in the CTIS search interface can be automatically copied to the
clipboard so that a user can paste them into `queryterm`, see
[here](#2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). As
of 2024-04-27, there are more than 730 trials publicly accessible in
CTIS. See [below](#documents-example) for how to download documents from
CTIS.

## Future features

- See project outline <https://github.com/users/rfhb/projects/1>

- Canonical definitions, filters, calculations are in the works (since
  August 2023) for data mangling and analyses across registers, e.g.¬†to
  define study population, identify interventional trials, calculate
  study duration; public collaboration on these canonical scripts will
  speed up harmonising analyses.

- Merge results-related fields retrieved from different registers, such
  as corresponding endpoints (work not yet started). The challenge is
  the incomplete congruency and different structure of data fields.

- Authentication, expected to be required by CTGOV2; specifications not
  yet known (work not yet started).

- Explore further registers such as
  [ICTRP](https://trialsearch.who.int/) (authentication needed),
  [JPRN](https://rctportal.niph.go.jp/),
  [jRCT](https://jrct.niph.go.jp/),
  [UMIN-CTR](https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/), ChiCTR (exploration is
  continually ongoing; added value, terms and conditions for
  programmatic access vary; no clear roadmap is established yet).

- ~~Retrieve previous versions of protocol- or results-related
  information. The challenges include, historic versions can only be
  retrieved one-by-one, do not include results, or are not in structured
  format.~~ (functionality available with version 1.17.2.9000 to the
  extent that seems reasonably possible at this time, namely for
  protocol-related information for CTIS and for protocol- and
  results-related information in CTGOV2)
