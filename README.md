# ctrdata for aggregating and analysing clinical trials

The package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading)
information on clinical trials from public registers, and for
aggregating and analysing this information; it can be used for the

- EU Clinical Trials Register (‚ÄúEUCTR‚Äù,
  <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>)
- ClinicalTrials.gov (‚ÄúCTGOV‚Äù or üîî‚ÄúCTGOV2‚Äù, see
  [example](#workflow-ctgov-example))
- ISRCTN (<https://www.isrctn.com/>)
- EU Clinical Trials Information System (‚ÄúCTIS‚Äù,
  <https://euclinicaltrials.eu/>) üîî see
  [example](#workflow-ctis-example)

The motivation is to investigate and understand trends in design and
conduct of trials, their availability for patients and to facilitate
using their detailed results for research and meta-analyses. `ctrdata`
is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system, but other
systems and tools can be used with the databases created with the
package. This README was reviewed on 2023-08-20 for version 1.14.0.9000
for [CTGOV changes](#workflow-ctgov-example).

## Main features

- Protocol- and results-related trial information is easily downloaded:
  Users define a query in a register‚Äôs web interface and then enter the
  URL into `ctrdata` which retrieves in one go all trials found.
  [Documents](#documents-example) in registers on trials can also be
  downloaded. Personal annotations can be made to trials when
  downloading a query. Synonyms of an active substance can also be
  found.
- Downloaded trial information is transformed and stored in a collection
  of a document-centric database, for fast and offline access.
  Information from different registers can be accumalated in a single
  collection. Uses `DuckDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `RSQLite` or `MongoDB`, via R
  package `nodbi`: see section
  [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata) below. Re-run
  any previous query in a collection to retrieve and update trial
  records.
- For analyses, convenience functions in `ctrdata` allow to identify
  unique (de-duplicated) trial records across registers, to merge and
  recode fields as well as to easily access deeply-nested fields.
  Analysis can be done with `R` or other systems, by accessing the
  structured information in the database.

URLs of queries in the registers can be automatically copied to the
clipboard (including for ‚ÄúCTIS‚Äù, where the URL does not show the query),
see
[here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser).

Remember to respect the registers‚Äô terms and conditions (see
`ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)`). Please cite this
package in any publication as follows: ‚ÄúRalf Herold (2023). *ctrdata:

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install
package `ctrdata`:

``` r
# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package‚Äôs dependencies (`nodbi`,
`jsonlite`, `httr`, `curl`, `clipr`, `xml2`, `rvest`, `lubridate` and
`stringi`).

### 2. Command line tools `perl`, `sed` and `php` (5.2 or higher)

These are required for `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`, the main function of
package `ctrdata` (see [Example workflow](#example-workflow)), to work
with the registers EUCTR, CTGOV, ISRCTN (but are not required to work
with CTIS); the function also checks if the tools can be used.

- For MS Windows, install [`Cygwin`](https://cygwin.org/install.html):
  In `R`, run `ctrdata::installCygwinWindowsDoInstall()` for an
  automated minimal installation. Alternatively, manually install Cygwin
  with packages `perl`, `php-jsonc` and `php-simplexml` into
  `c:\cygwin`. The installation needs about 160 MB disk space.

- In macOS including 11 Big Sur, these are already installed; as
  alternative and üîîfor macOS 12 Monterey and above,
  [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) can be used: `brew install php`, which
  seems to include all `php` libraries required for `ctrdata`.

- In Linux, these are usually already installed; tools to install vary
  by distribution (e.g., `sudo apt install php-cli php-xml php-json`).

### 3. Script to automatically copy user‚Äôs query from web browser

This is optional; it works with all registers supported by `ctrdata` but
is recommended for CTIS because the URL in the web browser does not
reflect the parameters the user specified for querying this register.

In the web browser, install the [Tampermonkey browser
extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), click on ‚ÄúNew user script‚Äù
and then on ‚ÄúTools‚Äù, then enter into ‚ÄúImport from URL‚Äù this URL:
[`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js)
and last click on ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù.

The browser extension can be disabled and enabled by the user. When
enabled, the URLs to all user‚Äôs queries in the registers are
automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into the
`queryterm=...` parameter of function `ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`.

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

The functions are listed in the approximate order of use in a user‚Äôs
workflow (in bold, main functions). See also the [package documentation

## Databases that can be used with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial information and stores it in a
database collection, which has to be given as a connection object to
parameter `con` for several `ctrdata` functions; this connection object
is created in slightly different ways for the four supported database
backends that can be used with `ctrdata` as shown in the table. For a
speed comparison, see the [nodbi
documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi#benchmark).

Besides ctrdata functions below, any such a connection object can
equally be used with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (last
row in table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite`
(see vignettes).

| Purpose                                   | Function call                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create **SQLite** database connection     | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                        |
| Create **MongoDB** database connection    | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                             |
| Create **PostgreSQL** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"`            |
| Create **DuckDB** database connection     | `dbc <- nodbi::src_duckdb(dbdir = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")`                         |
| Use connection with `ctrdata` functions   | `ctrdata::{ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, dbQueryHistory, dbFindIdsUniqueTrials, dbFindFields, dbGetFieldsIntoDf}(con = dbc, ...)` |
| Use connection with `nodbi` functions     | e.g., `nodbi::docdb_query(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)`                                                        |

- [Summarise and analyse clinical trial
  information](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html)

## Example workflow

The aim is to download protocol-related trial information and tabulate
the trials‚Äô status of conduct.

- Attach package `ctrdata`:

``` r
library(ctrdata)
```

- See help to get started with `ctrdata`:

``` r
help("ctrdata")
```

- Information on trial registers that can be used with `ctrdata`:

``` r
help("ctrdata-registers")
```

- Open registers‚Äô advanced search pages in browser:

``` r
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

- Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

- When trials of interest are listed in browser, *copy the address from
  the browser‚Äôs address bar to the clipboard*

- Search used in this example:
  <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed>

- Get address from clipboard:

``` r
q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed

q
#                                                   query-term  query-register
# 1 query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed           EUCTR
```

üîî Queries in the trial registers can automatically copied to the
clipboard (including for ‚ÄúCTIS‚Äù, where the URL does not show the query)
using our solution
[here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser).

- Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to database:

The database collection is specified first, using `nodbi` (see above for
how to specify `PostgreSQL`, `RSQlite`, `DuckDB` or `MongoDB` as
backend, see section
[Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata)); then, trial
information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:

``` r
# Connect to (or newly create) an SQLite database
# that is stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "some_database_name.sqlite_file",
  collection = "some_collection_name"
)

# Retrieve trials from public register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  euctrresults = TRUE,
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=cancer&age=under-18&phase=phase-one&status=completed
# Checking helper binaries: . . . . . done
# * Checking trials in EUCTR...
# Retrieved overview, multiple records of 92 trial(s) from 5 page(s) to be downloaded (estimate: 4.6 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trials...
# Note: register server cannot compress data, transfer takes longer, about 0.2s per trial
# Download status: 5 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 7.33 Mb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 353 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 353 records on 92 trial(s) 
# * Checking results if available from EUCTR for 92 trials: 
# (1/4) Downloading and extracting results (. = data, F = file[s] and data, x = none):
# Download status: 92 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 57.94 Mb (100%)... done!             
# F . F F . F . F . . . . F F . . . . . . F . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
# . . F . . . . F . . F . . . . . . F . . . . F . , 74 records converted
# (3/4) Importing JSON into database...
# (4/4) Results history: not retrieved (euctrresultshistory = FALSE)
# = Imported or updated results for 74 trials
# No history found in expected format.
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

Under the hood, scripts `euctr2json.sh` and `xml2json.php` (in
`ctrdata/exec`) transform EUCTR plain text files and CTGOV as well as
ISRCTN `XML` files to `ndjson` format, which is imported into the
database collection.

- Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric
development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP). `ctrdata`
functions return a data.frame (or a tibble, if package `tibble` is
loaded).

``` r
# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  fields = c(
    "a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan",
    "p_end_of_trial_status",
    "a2_eudract_number"
  ),
  con = db
)

# Find unique (deduplicated) trial identifiers for trials that have more than
# one record, for example for several EU Member States or in several registers:
uniqueids <- dbFindIdsUniqueTrials(con = db)
# Searching for duplicate trials... 
#  - Getting all trial identifiers (may take some time), 353 found in collection
#  - Finding duplicates among registers' and sponsor ids...
#  - 261 EUCTR _id were not preferred EU Member State record for 92 trials
#  - Keeping 92 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 records from EUCTR / CTGOV / CTGOV2 / ISRCTN / CTIS
# = Returning keys (_id) of 92 records in collection "some_collection_name"

# Keep only unique / de-duplicated records:
result <- subset(
  result,
  subset = `_id` %in% uniqueids
)

# Tabulate the selected clinical trial information:
with(
  result,
  table(
    p_end_of_trial_status,
    a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
  )
)
#                           a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan
# p_end_of_trial_status      FALSE TRUE

- Add records from another register (CTGOV) into the same collection

üîîBoth the current and classic CTGOV website are supported as of
2023-08-05. The new website and API introduced in July 2023
(<https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/>) is identified in `ctrdata` as
`CTGOV2`. The website and API which is now called ‚Äúclassic‚Äù
(<https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/>) is identified in `ctrdata` as
`CTGOV`, and this is backwards-compatible with queries that were
previously retrieved with `ctrdata`.

Both use the same trial identifier (e.g., NCT01234567) for the same
trial. As a consequence, queries for the same trial retrieved using
`CTGOV` or `CTGOV2` overwrite any previous record for that trial,
whether loaded from `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`. Thus, only a single version
(the last retrieved) will be in the collection in the user‚Äôs database.

Important differences exist between field names and contents of
information retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`; see the [XML schemas
for `CTGOV`](https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/prs-xml-schemas.html)
and the [REST API for
`CTGOV2`](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/learn-about-api).
For more details, call `help("ctrdata-registers")`. This is one of the
reasons why `ctrdata` handles the situation as if these were two
different registers.

- Search used in this example:
  <https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int",
  register = "CTGOV2",
  con = db
)
# Appears specific for CTGOV REST API 2.0.0
# * Found search query from CTGOV2: cond=Neuroblastoma&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,studyType:int
# * Checking trials using CTGOV API 2.0.0.-test, found 88 trials
# (1/2) Downloading and converting in 1 batch(es) (max. 1000 trials each; estimate: 8.8 MB total)
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 8.75 Mb (837%)...converting to NDJSON...
# (2/2) Importing JSON records into database...
# JSON file #: 1 / 1                               
# = Imported / updated 88 records on 88 trial(s)
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

- Using an example from classic CTGOV:
  <https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug",
  con = db
)
# Appears specific for CTGOV CLASSIC API
# * Found search query from CTGOV: cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
# Checking helper binaries: done
# * Checking trials in CTGOV classic...
# Retrieved overview, records of 55 trial(s) are to be downloaded (estimate: 0.44 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trial file...
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 755.00 Kb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 55 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 55 trial(s)                
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

- Add records from a third register (ISRCTN) into the same collection

Search used in this example:
<https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma>

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=neuroblastoma",
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from ISRCTN: q=neuroblastoma
# Checking helper binaries: done
# * Checking trials in ISRCTN...
# Retrieved overview, records of 9 trial(s) are to be downloaded (estimate: 0.16 MB)
# (1/3) Downloading trial file... 
# Download status: 1 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 93.10 Kb (100%)... done!             
# (2/3) Converting to JSON, 9 records converted
# (3/3) Importing JSON records into database...
# = Imported or updated 9 trial(s)                 
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "some_collection_name")
```

<div id="workflow-ctis-example">

</div>

- Add records from a fourth register (CTIS üîî) into the same collection

Queries in the CTIS search interface can be automatically copied to the
clipboard so that a user can paste them into `queryterm`, see
[here](#3-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser). As
of June 2023, more than 200 trials are publicly accessible in CTIS. See
[below](#documents-example) for how to download documents from CTIS.

``` r
# Retrieve trials from another register:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "https://euclinicaltrials.eu/app/#/search?ageGroupCode=2",
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from CTIS: ageGroupCode=2
# * Checking trials in EUCTR...
# (1/5) Downloading trials list, found 32 trials
# (2/5) Downloading and processing part I and parts II... (estimate: 4.8 Mb)
# Download status: 32 done; 0 in progress. Total size: 4.94 Mb (100%)... done!

## Additional features under consideration

- Retrieve previous versions of protocol- or results-related
  information. The challenge is that, apparently, initial versions
  cannot be queried and historical versions can only be retrieved
  one-by-one and not in structured format.

- Merge results-related fields retrieved from different registers (e.g.,
  corresponding endpoints). The challenge is the incomplete congruency
  and different structure of fields.

### Issues and notes

- Please file issues and bugs
  [here](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues). Also check out how to
  handle some of the closed issues, e.g.¬†on [C stack usage too close to
  the limit](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22) and on a [SSL
  certificate problem: unable to get local issuer
  certificate](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/19#issuecomment-820127139)

- Information in trial registers may not be fully correct; see for
  example [this publication on
  CTGOV](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1452).

- No attempts were made to harmonise field names between registers
  (nevertheless, `dfMergeVariablesRelevel()` can be used to merge and
  map several variables / fields into one).
