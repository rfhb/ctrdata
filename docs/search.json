Note that the fields and data schema of trials differ between CTGOV and CTGOV2.  #>  #> Replace this URL: #>  #> term=AREA[MaximumAge]+RANGE[0+days,+28+days]&intr=Drugs,+Investigational&strd_s=01/01/2018&strd_e=01/01/2020&type=Intr&phase=2 #>  #> with this URL: #>  #> https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?start=2018-01-01_2020-01-01&term=AREA[MaximumAge] RANGE[0 days, 28 days]&intr=Drugs, Investigational&aggFilters=phase:3,studyType:int"},{"path":"https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrShowOneTrial.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Show full structure and all data of a trial — ctrShowOneTrial","title":"Show full structure and all data of a trial — ctrShowOneTrial","text":"used interactively, function shows widget data trial tree field names values. widget opens default browser.

Participants in this arm received brivaracetam (BRV) 0.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) administered as an intravenous (iv) solution for injection twice daily (bid) during the 48-hour Evaluation Period. An additional 3 doses of BRV (0.5 mg/kg) could have been administered every 12 hours for 48 hours (at the discretion of the Investigator). Treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) per standard of care (SToC) (first-line, second-line, or subsequent treatment) were continued in parallel with BRV treatment. #> 24

Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of Adverse Events serious and non-serious, with particular attention being paid to infections    - Evolution of laboratory parameters such as complete blood cell count CBC, with a focus on red cells haemoglobin, neutrophils and platelets, liver tests, renal function tests and coagulation    - Number of patients withdrawn for safety issues  Evolution of clinical signs fever, splenomegaly, CNS symptoms and laboratory parameters CBC, fibrinogen, serum triglycerides, ferritin, soluble CD-25 levels, which characterize the disease, will be used to assess response and time to response. As this is a pilot study, all endpoints will be considered exploratory.    - Number of patients showing partial or complete response by week 2, 4 or 8    - Number of patients achieving non-active disease by week 8    - Time to achievement of non-active disease state    - Time to achievement of complete response    - Time to achievement of partial response    - Time to reactivation    - Survival at week 8 and at the end of the follow-up period week 12    - Number of patients achieving no response at any time     - Number of patients showing reactivation at any time. == See E.5.1. #>

                                                     The primary endpoint of the study is treatment safety, which is defined as PcCO2 between 4,7 kPa and 6,5 kPa and an AHI < 15 without complaints of SAS in patients without SAS and an AHI < 5 in patients with treated SAS. If patients use a CPAP device, it may be adjusted to stay within the safe margin. This adjustment will be registered. The spirometry is not used for safety reasons but to determine the effect of ITB on pulmonary function #> 13

assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications. DLT included any grade 3 or 4 clinically-evident toxicity, Hematology: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 neutropenia (ANC \\\\<1.0x10\\\\^9/L); ≥ CTCAE grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets \\\\<50x10\\\\^9/L); ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anemia (Hgb \\\\<80 g/L); Febrile neutropenia (ANC \\\\<1x10\\\\^9/L, fever ‡ 38.5°C), Renal: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 serum creatinine (\\\\>3xULN), Hepatic: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 total bilirubin (\\\\>3xULN); ≥ 10xULN ALT elevation; grade 2 total bilirubin (\\\\>1.5ULN) together with ≥ grade 3 ALT elevation (\\\\>5xULN), Cardiac: ≥ CTCAE grade 3, Other AEs: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 vomiting or nausea despite optimal antiemetic therapy, diarrhea despite optimal antidiarrheal treatment. == Baseline, End of dose escalation part (Day 42), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Sonidegib for Prolonged Use == MTD was defined as highest dose level for which no more than 1 participant in a dose cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), based on Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) employing the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle. DLT was defined as an adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications.k == Baseline, End of dose escalation part (Day 42), Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Treatment == The tumor response to the sonidegib treatment was measured by ORR. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with partial response or complete response as their best overall response. Participants with stable disease, progressive disease tumor assessment were considered as non-responders. Response evaluation criteria was gadolinium chelate-enhanced brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) for Medulloblastoma and central nervous system (CNS) tumors and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for non-CNS tumors assessed by MRI. Complete Response (CR), Progressive Disease (PD) and Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) were defined as disappearance of all non-target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and Neither CR nor PD, respectively. == Baseline, Day 28 of Cycle 2, End of treatment (Within 14 days of last dose) #> 21

in combination with Irinotecan and Temozolomide (TPI+I+TMZ) in pediatric and young adult patients with primary refractory or recurrent Neuroblastoma.\\n\\nPhase I patients were all enrolled to receive TPI 287. Phase 2 is where randomization began. Patients were different patients than the Phase 1 patients. Below all patients that received TPI 287 are included in the TPI 287 group. This includes Phase I patients and the Phase 2 patients randomized to TPI 287. == 6 months, Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants Using RECIST Criteria == Phase I portion of trial- All patients enrolled to recieve TPI+I+TMZ. These patients will be added to the Phase II patients that were randomized to Arm B- Arm with TPI 287 (recieved same tx as Phase I participatns).\\n\\nPhase II portion of trial- TPatients enrolled to this portion (different patients than enrolled to Phase 1) were randomized to Arm A: I+TMZ OR Arm B: TPI+I+TMZ Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \\\\>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall

collected and measured in 6 hour increments beginning 6 hours prior to starting fenoldopam or placebo infusion. The first dose of indomethacin will be given 12 hours after starting fenoldopam or placebo. Two additional doses of indomethacin will be given 12 hours apart. Urine will continue to be collected and volume measured in 6 hour increments up to 24 hrs after the last dose of indomethacin. To summarize, urine will be collected and measured from time -6 hours to 0 hours. Fenoldapam or placebo will be initiated at time 0 hrs, indomethacin given at time 12, 24 and 36 hours, and urine collected and measured to time 60 hours. == 66 hrs - from 6 hrs before beginning of fenoldopam or placebo infusion up to 24 hours after the last dose of indomethacin, Serum Levels of Fenoldopam During Infusion of the Drug and Following Discontinuation of the Drug Will be Measured by Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy. == Blood samples for determination of serum fenoldopam levels will be obtained immediately prior to starting the infusion of fenoldopam (time 0 hour), continue through the 48 hour period of fenoldopam infusion and continue for an additional 12 hours after stopping the fenoldopam infusion. == 60 hours, Change in Levels of Serum Albumin (mg/dl) == Period from just prior to first dose of indomethacin (time point 12 hours) to 24 hours beyond last dose of indomethacin ( which is time point 60 hours).

        All infants with a gestation ≥ 34 weeks and a birth weight ≥ 2000 grams admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a clinical diagnosis of PPHN, and commenced on iNO will be deemed potentially eligible for this study. The process of iNO initiation in PPHN on clinical grounds is standardised in the NICUs.

In case the diagnosis of HLH is based on the 5 of the 8 above criteria and not on a molecular finding or a familial history consistent with primary HLH, the patient is eligible to enter the study if there is a. Reactivation, or Worsening, or No Further Improvement for at least 4 weeks from initiation of treatment of the disease after having achieved at least Partial or Incomplete Response see definitions in Table 1. In this specific situation, Worsening and No Further Improvement must include abnormal sCD25 or ferritin  2000 ng/ml OR a.b. No Response for at least 2 weeks from initiation of treatment or Worsening of the disease without previous Partial or Incomplete Response. Soluble CD25 must be abnormal or ferritin  2000 ng/ml and the evaluation and approval by the Scientific Steering Committee is mandatory see definitions in Table 1 OR b.c. Intolerance to conventional treatment of HLH, as judged by the treating physician and approval by the Scientific Steering Committee is mandatory  4. Patients must have received treatment for HLH according to the conventional therapy at the site e.g. corticosteroids alone or in combination with etoposide, cyclosporin, methotrexate etc.. At the time of enrollment, eligible patients might still be receiving treatment induction or maintenance or might have already discontinued it. 5.

Unless there is an increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to \\\\> 500 in the following 7 days, bone marrow aspirate should be repeated on day +28.
