Package `ctrdata` provides functions for retrieving (downloading),
aggregating and analysing clinical trials using information (structured
protocol and result data, as well as documents) from public registers.
It can be used with the

- EU Clinical Trials Register (“EUCTR”,
  <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/>)
- EU Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”,
  <https://euclinicaltrials.eu/>, [example](#workflow-ctis-example))
- ClinicalTrials.gov (“CTGOV2”, <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>,
  [example](#workflow-ctgov-example))
- ISRCTN Registry (“ISRCTN”, <https://www.isrctn.com/>)

Additional registers are being explored. The package facilitates
investigating across registers the design and conduct of trials of
interest, to describe their trends and availability for patients and to
facilitate using their detailed results for research and meta-analyses.
`ctrdata` is a package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) system,
but other systems and tools can use the databases created with this
package. This README was reviewed on 2026-01-18 for version 1.26.0.9000.

## Main features

- Trial information is easily found and downloaded: `ctrdata` generates
  queries for all registers or takes a user query in a register’s web
  interface, then `ctrdata` retrieves in one go all protocol- and
  results-related trials data. A
  [script](#id_2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser)
  can automate using the query URL from all registers. Annotations can
  be made when downloading trials, [trial documents](#documents-example)
  and [historic
  versions](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#historic-versions-of-trial-records-and-changes-in-sample-sizes)
  can be downloaded.

- Downloaded trial information is stored in a document-centric database,
  for fast and offline access. Information from different registers can
  be accumulated in a single collection. Uses `RSQLite`, `DuckDB`,
  `PostgreSQL` or `MongoDB`, see
  [Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata). Interactively
  browse through trial structure and data. Easily re-run a previous
  query to update trial records.

- For analyses, `ctrdata` functions suggest canonical [trial
  concepts](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrdata-trial-concepts.html)
  to simplify analyses across registers, find synonyms of an active
  substance, identify unique (de-duplicated) trial records across all
  registers, merge and recode fields as well as easily access
  deeply-nested fields. Analyses can be done with `R` (see
  [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html))
  and other systems, using the stored `JSON`-structured data.

## Installation

### 1. Install package `ctrdata` in R

Package `ctrdata` is [on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctrdata) and [on
GitHub](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata). Within
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), use the following commands to install
package `ctrdata`:

``` r

# Install CRAN version:
install.packages("ctrdata")

# Alternatively, install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rfhb/ctrdata", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

These commands also install the package’s dependencies (`jsonlite`,
`httr2`, `xml2`, `nodbi`, `stringi`, `lubridate`, `jqr`, `dplyr`, `zip`,
`readr`, `rlang`, `htmlwidgets`, `stringdist` and `V8`).

### 2. Script to automatically copy user’s query from web browser

Optional; works with all registers supported by `ctrdata` and is
recommended for CTIS so that its URL in the web browser reflects the
user’s parameters for querying this register.

In the web browser, install the [Tampermonkey browser
extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), click on “New user script”
and then on “Tools”, enter into “Import from URL” this URL:
[`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfhb/ctrdata/master/tools/ctrdataURLcopier.js)
and then click on “Install”.

The browser extension can be disabled and enabled by the user. When
enabled, the URLs to all user’s queries in the registers are
automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into the
`queryterm = ...` parameter of function
[ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrLoadQueryIntoDb.html).

Additionally, this script retrieves results for `CTIS` when opening
search URLs such as
[`https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria={"status":[3,4]}`](https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria=%7B%22status%22:%5B3,4%5D%7D).
After changing the URL in the browser, a “Reload page” is needed to
conduct the search and show results.

## Overview of functions in `ctrdata`

Selected functions are listed in the approximate order of use in a
user’s workflow (in bold, main functions). See all functions in the
[package documentation
overview](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/index.html).

| [`dfTrials2Long()`](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dfTrials2Long.md) | Transform the data.frame from [`dbGetFieldsIntoDf()`](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dbGetFieldsIntoDf.md) into a long name-value data.frame, including deeply nested fields |
| [`dfName2Value()`](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dfName2Value.md) | From a long name-value data.frame, extract values for variables (fields) of interest (e.g., endpoints) |

## Data model of `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` uses the data models that are implicit in data as
retrieved from the different registers. No mapping is provided for any
register’s data model to a putative target data model. The reasons
include that registers’ data models are continually evolving over time,
that only few data fields have similar values and meaning between
registers, and that the retrieved public data may not correspond to the
registers’ internal data model. The structure of data for a specific
trial can interactively be inspected and searched using function, see
the section [below](#workflow-data-model).

Thus, the handling of data from different models of registers is to be
done at the time of analysis. This approach allows a high level of
flexibility, transparency and reproducibility. To support analyses,
`ctrdata` (from version 1.21.0) provides functions that calculate
concepts of clinical trials across registers, which are commonly used in
analyses, such as start dates, age groups and statistical tests of
results. See
[help(ctrdata-trial-concepts)](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrdata-trial-concepts.html)
and the section [Analysis across
trials](#workflow-across-registers-example) in the example workflow
below. For further analyses, see examples of function
[dfMergeVariablesRelevel()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dfMergeVariablesRelevel.html)
on how to align related fields from different registers for a joint
analysis.

In any of the
[databases](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/index.html#databases-for-use-with-ctrdata),
one clinical trial is one document, corresponding to one row in a
`SQLite`, `PostgreSQL` or `DuckDB` table, and to one document in a
`MongoDB` collection. These `NoSQL` backends allow documents to have
different structures, which is used here to accommodate the different
models of data retrieved from the registers. Package `ctrdata` stores in
every such document:

- field `_id` with the trial identification as provided by the register
  from which it was retrieved
- field `ctrname` with the name of the register (`EUCTR`, `CTGOV`,
  `CTGOV2`, `ISRCTN`, `CTIS`) from which that trial was retrieved
- field `record_last_import` with the date and time when that document
  was last updated using
  [`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb()`](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrLoadQueryIntoDb.md)
- only for `CTGOV2` and `CTIS`: object `history` with a historic version
  of the trial and with `history_version`, which contains the fields
  `version_number` (starting from 1) and `version_date`
- all original fields as provided by the register for that trial (see
  example in
  [vignette](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#historic-versions-of-trial-records-and-changes-in-sample-sizes))

For visualising the data structure for a trial, see this [vignette
section](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html#analysing-nested-fields-such-as-trial-results).

## Databases for use with `ctrdata`

Package `ctrdata` retrieves trial data and stores it in a database
collection, which has to be given as a connection object to parameter
`con` for several `ctrdata` functions. This connection object is created
almost identically for the four database backends supported by
`ctrdata`, as shown in the table. For a speed comparison, see the [nodbi
documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi#benchmark).

Besides `ctrdata` functions below, such a connection object can be used
with functions of other packages, such as `nodbi` (see last row in
table) or, in case of MongoDB as database backend, `mongolite` (see
vignettes).

| Purpose | Function call |
|----|----|
| Create **SQLite** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_sqlite(dbname = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")` |
| Create **DuckDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_duckdb(dbdir = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")` |
| Create **MongoDB** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_mongo(db = "name_of_my_database", collection = "name_of_my_collection")` |
| Create **PostgreSQL** database connection | `dbc <- nodbi::src_postgres(dbname = "name_of_my_database"); dbc[["collection"]] <- "name_of_my_collection"` |
| Use connection with `ctrdata` functions | `ctrdata::{ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, dbQueryHistory, dbFindIdsUniqueTrials, dbFindFields, dbGetFieldsIntoDf}(con = dbc, ...)` |
| Use connection with `nodbi` functions | e.g., `nodbi::docdb_query(src = dbc, key = dbc$collection, ...)` |

## Vignettes

- [Install R package
  ctrdata](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_install.html)
- [Retrieve clinical trial
  information](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_retrieve.html)
- [Summarise and analyse clinical trial
  information](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/articles/ctrdata_summarise.html)

## Example workflow

The aim of the example is to download protocol-related trial information
and tabulate the trials’ status of conduct.

- Attach package `ctrdata`:

``` r

library(ctrdata)
```

- See help to get started with `ctrdata`:

``` r

help("ctrdata")
```

- Information on trial registers, their contents and how they can be
  used with `ctrdata` (last updated 2026-01-11):

``` r

help("ctrdata-registers")
```

- Open registers’ advanced search pages in browser:

``` r

ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser()

# Please review and respect register copyrights:
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(copyright = TRUE)
```

- Adjust search parameters and execute search in browser

- When trials of interest are listed in browser, *copy the address from
  the browser’s address bar to the clipboard*

- Search used in this example:
  <https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children#tabs>

- Get address from clipboard:

``` r

q <- ctrGetQueryUrl()
# * Using clipboard content as register query URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children

q
#                                         query-term query-register
# 1 query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children          EUCTR
```

Queries in the trial registers can automatically copied to the clipboard
(including for “CTIS”, where the URL otherwise does not show the user’s
query), see
[here](#id_2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser).

- Retrieve protocol-related information, transform and save to database:

For loading the trial information, first a database collection is
specified, using `nodbi` (see above for how to specify `PostgreSQL`,
`RSQlite`, `DuckDB` or `MongoDB` as backend, see section
[Databases](#databases-that-can-be-used-with-ctrdata)):

``` r

# Connect to (or create) an SQLite database
# stored in a file on the local system:
db <- nodbi::src_sqlite(
  dbname = "database_name.sql",
  collection = "collection_name"
)
```

Then, the trial information is retrieved and loaded into the collection:

``` r

# Retrieve trials from public register EUCTR,
# both protocol- and results-related data:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  euctrresults = TRUE,
  euctrprotocolsall = FALSE, # new since 2025-07-20, loads single 
  # instead of all available country versions of a trial in EUCTR
  con = db
)
# * Found search query from EUCTR: query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children
# * Checking trials in EUCTR, found 73 trials 
# - Downloading in 4 batch(es) (20 trials each; estimate: 9 MB)
# - Downloading 73 records of 73 trials (estimate: 4 s)               
# - Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 0.2 s)...                           
# - Importing records into database...
# = Imported or updated 73 records on 73 trial(s)  
# * Checking results if available from EUCTR for 73 trials: 
# - Downloading results...
# - Extracting results (. = data, F = file[s] and data, x = none): . . . F . . . F . . F . . . . . . . F . F F . . . . . . F . . . . 
# - Data found for 33 trials
# - Converting to NDJSON (estimate: 1 s)...
# - Importing 33 results into database (may take some time)...
# - Results history: not retrieved (euctrresultshistory = FALSE)
# = Imported or updated results for 33 trials
# No history found in expected format.
# Updated history ("meta-info" in "collection_name")
# $n
# [1] 73
```

Under the hood, plain text from EUCTR and XML files from EUCTR, CTGOV,
ISRCTN are converted using Javascript via `V8` in `R` into `NDJSON`,
which is imported into the database collection.

- Easily generate queries for each register and add records from several
  registers into the same collection

The same parameters can be used to ask `ctrdata` to generate search
queries that apply to each register, for opening the web interfaces and
for loading the trial data into the collection:

``` r

# Generate queries for each register
queries <- ctrGenerateQueries(
  condition = "neuroblastoma",
  recruitment = "completed",
  phase = "phase 2",
  population = "P"
)

queries
# EUCTR 
# "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=neuroblastoma&phase=phase-two&age=children&age=adolescent&age=infant-and-toddler&age=newborn&age=preterm-new-born-infants&age=under-18&status=completed" 
# ISRCTN 
# "https://www.isrctn.com/search?&q=&filters=condition:neuroblastoma,phase:Phase II,ageRange:Child,trialStatus:completed,primaryStudyDesign:Interventional" 
# CTGOV2

# CTIS 
# "https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search#searchCriteria={\"medicalCondition\":\"neuroblastoma\",\"trialPhaseCode\":[4],\"ageGroupCode\":[2],\"status\":[5,8]}"   

# Open queries in registers' web interfaces
# Note the regular and expert CTGOV2 query
sapply(queries, ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser)

# Load all queries into database collection
result <- lapply(queries, ctrLoadQueryIntoDb, con = db)

sapply(result, "[[", "n")
# EUCTR       ISRCTN       CTGOV2 CTGOV2expert         CTIS 
#   180            0          105          105            1
```

- Analyse

Tabulate the status of trials that are part of an agreed paediatric
development program (paediatric investigation plan, PIP). `ctrdata`
functions return a data.frame (or a tibble, if package `tibble` is
loaded).

``` r

# Get all records that have values in the fields of interest:
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  # Field of interest
  fields = c("a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan"),
  # Trial concepts calculated across registers
  calculate = c("f.statusRecruitment", "f.isUniqueTrial"),
  con = db
)
# To review trial concepts details, call 'help("ctrdata-trial-concepts")'
# Querying database (16 fields)...
# Searching for duplicate trials...                             
# - Getting all trial identifiers (may take some time), 316 found in collection

  result[result$.isUniqueTrial, ],
  table(
    .statusRecruitment,

  )
)
#                   a7_trial_is_part_of_a_paediatric_investigation_plan

```

- Queries to CTGOV and CTGOV2

The new website and API introduced in July 2023
(<https://clinicaltrials.gov/>) is supported by `ctrdata` since mid-2023
and identified in `ctrdata` as `CTGOV2`.

On 2024-06-25, `CTGOV` retired the classic website and API used by
`ctrdata` since 2015. To support users, `ctrdata` automatically
translates and redirects queries to the current website. This helps with
automatically updating previously loaded queries
(`ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(querytoupdate = <n>)`), manually migrating queries
and reproducible work on clinical trials information. Going forward,
users are recommended to change to use `CTGOV2` queries.

As regards study data, important differences exist between field names
and contents of information retrieved using `CTGOV` or `CTGOV2`; see the
[schema for study protocols in
`CTGOV`](https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/documents/xsd/prs/ProtocolRecordSchema.xsd),
the [schema for study
results](https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/documents/xsd/prs/RRSUploadSchema.xsd)
and the [Study Data Structure for
`CTGOV2`](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/about-api/study-data-structure).
For more details, call
[`help("ctrdata-registers")`](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrdata-registers.md).
This is one of the reasons why `ctrdata` handles the situation as if
these were two different registers and will continue to identify the
current API as `register = "CTGOV2"`, to support the analysis stage.

Note that loading trials with `ctrdata` overwrites the previous record
with `CTGOV2` data, whether the previous record was retrieved using
`CTGOV` or `CTGOV2` queries.

Example using a CTGOV query:

``` r

# CTGOV search query URL
q <- "https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug"

# Open old URL (CTGOV) in current website (CTGOV2):
ctrOpenSearchPagesInBrowser(q)
# Since 2024-06-25, the classic CTGOV servers are no longer available. Package ctrdata has translated the classic CTGOV query URL from this call of function ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(queryterm = ...) into a query URL that works with the current CTGOV2. This is printed below and is also part of the return value of this function, ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(...)$url. This URL can be used with ctrdata functions. Note that the fields and data schema of trials differ between CTGOV and CTGOV2.
# 
# Replace this URL:
# 
# https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=neuroblastoma&rslt=With&recrs=e&age=0&intr=Drug
# 
# with this URL:
# 
# https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,status:com
# 
# * Found search query from CTGOV2: cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,status:com
# [1] "https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=neuroblastoma&intr=Drug&aggFilters=ages:child,results:with,status:com"

# Count trials
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = q,
  con = db,
  only.count = TRUE
)
# $n
# [1] 67
```

- Queries to CTIS

Queries in the CTIS search interface
(<https://euclinicaltrials.eu/ctis-public/search>) can be automatically
copied to the clipboard so that a user can paste them into `queryterm`,
see
[here](#id_2-script-to-automatically-copy-users-query-from-web-browser).
Subsequent to the relaunch of CTIS on 2024-07-24, there are now more
than 10,600 trials publicly accessible in CTIS. See
[below](#documents-example) for how to download documents from CTIS.

``` r

# See how many trials are in CTIS publicly accessible:
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = "",
  register = "CTIS",
  only.count = TRUE
)
# $n
# [1] 10683

# Trials in therapeutic area neoplasms (ICD C04):
ctrLoadQueryIntoDb(
  queryterm = 'searchCriteria={"therapeuticAreaCode":[4]}',
  register = "CTIS",
  only.count = TRUE
)
# * Found search query from CTIS: searchCriteria={"therapeuticAreaCode":[4]}
# * Checking trials in CTIS, found 3532 trials 
# = Not done (only.count = TRUE): Imported 3532 trial(s)
# $n
# [1] 3532
```

- Inspect and search structure of trial information

For a given trial, function
[ctrShowOneTrial()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/ctrShowOneTrial.html)
enables the user to visualise the hiearchy of fields and contents in the
user’s local web browser, to search for field names and field values,
and to select and copy selected fields’ names for use with function
[dbGetFieldsIntoDf()](https://rfhb.github.io/ctrdata/reference/dbGetFieldsIntoDf.html).

``` r

# This opens a local browser for user interaction.
# If the trial identifier (_id) is not found in the specified 
# collection, it will be retrieved from the relevant register.
ctrShowOneTrial(
  identifier = "2024-518931-12-00",
  con = db
)
```

ctrShowOneTrial

- Analysis across registers

Show cumulative start of trials over time. This uses the calculation of
one of the trial concepts that are implemented in `ctrdata` since
version 1.21.0.

``` r

# explore 20 pre-defined concepts for 
# trial analysis across registers
help("ctrdata-trial-concepts")

# use helper packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# calculate concept across registers
result <- dbGetFieldsIntoDf(
  calculate = c(
    "f.statusRecruitment", 
    "f.isUniqueTrial", 
    "f.startDate"),
  con = db
)
# To review trial concepts details, call 'help("ctrdata-trial-concepts")'
# Querying database (24 fields)...

# plot concepts
result %>%
  filter(.isUniqueTrial) %>%
  ggplot() +

## Future features

- See project outline <https://github.com/users/rfhb/projects/1>

- Authentication, expected to be required by CTGOV2; specifications not
  yet known (work not yet started).

- Explore further registers (exploration is continually ongoing; added
  value, terms and conditions for programmatic access vary; no clear
  roadmap is established yet).

## Issues and notes

- Information in trial registers may not be fully correct; see for
  example [this publication on
  CTGOV](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1452).

- A warning may be issued and a record not imported if the complexity of
  the XML content is too high for processing. The issue can be resolved
  by increasing in the operating system the stack size available to R,
  see: <https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22>

- Please file issues and bugs
  [here](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues).

  to the limit](https://github.com/rfhb/ctrdata/issues/22) and on a [SSL
