Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of Adverse Events serious and non-serious, with particular attention being paid to infections    - Evolution of laboratory parameters such as complete blood cell count CBC, with a focus on red cells haemoglobin, neutrophils and platelets, liver tests, renal function tests and coagulation    - Number of patients withdrawn for safety issues  Evolution of clinical signs fever, splenomegaly, CNS symptoms and laboratory parameters CBC, fibrinogen, serum triglycerides, ferritin, soluble CD-25 levels, which characterize the disease, will be used to assess response and time to response. As this is a pilot study, all endpoints will be considered exploratory.    - Number of patients showing partial or complete response by week 2, 4 or 8    - Number of patients achieving non-active disease by week 8    - Time to achievement of non-active disease state    - Time to achievement of complete response    - Time to achievement of partial response    - Time to reactivation    - Survival at week 8 and at the end of the follow-up period week 12    - Number of patients achieving no response at any time     - Number of patients showing reactivation at any time. == See E.5.1.</span>

endpoints of this study are: - Visual acuity as assessed by an age appropriate method - Ocular alignment and ocular motor examination in primary gaze and in as many of 9 positions of gaze as possible as assessed by corneal light reflex and by the cover test - Assessment of nystagmus by observation - Refraction as assessed by retinoscopy with cycloplegia - Stereoacuity as assessed with the Lang Stereotest == will vary depending upon age at enrollment, but subjects will not be followed beyond age 5.5 years corrected age CA</span>

endpoints of this study are: - Visual acuity as assessed by an age appropriate method - Ocular alignment and ocular motor examination in primary gaze and in as many of 9 positions of gaze as possible as assessed by corneal light reflex and by the cover test - Assessment of nystagmus by observation - Refraction as assessed by retinoscopy with cycloplegia - Stereoacuity as assessed with the Lang Stereotest == will vary depending upon age at enrollment, but subjects will not be followed beyond age 5.5 years corrected age CA</span>

&lt; 15 without complaints of SAS in patients without SAS and an AHI &lt; 5 in patients with treated SAS. If patients use a CPAP device, it may be adjusted to stay within the safe margin. This adjustment will be registered. The spirometry is not used for safety reasons but to determine the effect of ITB on pulmonary function</span>

DLT included any grade 3 or 4 clinically-evident toxicity, Hematology: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 neutropenia (ANC \\&lt;1.0x10\\^9/L); ≥ CTCAE grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets \\&lt;50x10\\^9/L); ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anemia (Hgb \\&lt;80 g/L); Febrile neutropenia (ANC \\&lt;1x10\\^9/L, fever ‡ 38.5°C), Renal: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 serum creatinine (\\&gt;3xULN), Hepatic: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 total bilirubin (\\&gt;3xULN); ≥ 10xULN ALT elevation; grade 2 total bilirubin (\\&gt;1.5ULN) together with ≥ grade 3 ALT elevation (\\&gt;5xULN), Cardiac: ≥ CTCAE grade 3, Other AEs: ≥ CTCAE grade 3 vomiting or nausea despite optimal antiemetic therapy, diarrhea despite optimal antidiarrheal treatment. == Baseline, End of dose escalation part (Day 42), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Sonidegib for Prolonged Use == MTD was defined as highest dose level for which no more than 1 participant in a dose cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), based on Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) employing the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle. DLT was defined as an adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications.k == Baseline, End of dose escalation part (Day 42), Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Treatment == The tumor response to the sonidegib treatment was measured by ORR. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with partial response or complete response as their best overall response. Participants with stable disease, progressive disease tumor assessment were considered as non-responders. Response evaluation criteria was gadolinium chelate-enhanced brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) for Medulloblastoma and central nervous system (CNS) tumors and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for non-CNS tumors assessed by MRI. Complete Response (CR), Progressive Disease (PD) and Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) were defined as disappearance of all non-target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and Neither CR nor PD, respectively. == Baseline, Day 28 of Cycle 2, End of treatment (Within 14 days of last dose)</span>

Measure of Safety and Tolerability == To determine the safety and tolerability of TPI 287 in combination with Irinotecan and Temozolomide (TPI+I+TMZ) in pediatric and young adult patients with primary refractory or recurrent Neuroblastoma.\n\nPhase I patients were all enrolled to receive TPI 287. Phase 2 is where randomization began. Patients were different patients than the Phase 1 patients. Below all patients that received TPI 287 are included in the TPI 287 group. This includes Phase I patients and the Phase 2 patients randomized to TPI 287. == 6 months, Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants Using RECIST Criteria == Phase I portion of trial- All patients enrolled to recieve TPI+I+TMZ. These patients will be added to the Phase II patients that were randomized to Arm B- Arm with TPI 287 (recieved same tx as Phase I participatns).\n\nPhase II portion of trial- TPatients enrolled to this portion (different patients than enrolled to Phase 1) were randomized to Arm A: I+TMZ OR Arm B: TPI+I+TMZ Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \\&gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. == 3 years</span>

Urine will continue to be collected and volume measured in 6 hour increments up to 24 hrs after the last dose of indomethacin. To summarize, urine will be collected and measured from time -6 hours to 0 hours.

Thus, this aspect of study takes place between time point 12 hr and time point 60 hr, which is a 48 hour period == 48 hrs, Changes in Serum Creatinine (mg/dl) == Serum creatinine will be measured immediately prior to first dose of indomethacin, immediately prior to the third dose of indomethacin (24 hr later) and 24 hours after the third dose of indomethacin == 48 hours, Serum Levels of Fenoldopam Will be Related the Changes in Urine Volume == We will relate serum levels of fenoldopam to changes in urine volume over the duration of time of fenoldopam infusion and after discontinuation of infusion. This constitutes part of the pharmacodynamic analysis == 60 hours, Serum Levels of Fenoldopam Will be Related to Absolute and Relative Changes in Serum Creatinine == We will relate serum levels of fenoldopam to serum creatinine values over the duration of time of fenoldopam infusion and after discontinuation of infusion.
