The process of iNO initiation in PPHN on clinical grounds is standardised in the NICUs.  In addition, the infants must satisfy the following criteria:  1.  ≤ 10 postnatal days of life and within 24 hrs of admission 2.  Echocardiography diagnosis of PPHN (see below)3.

A comprehensive assessment of PDA significance will be performed using echocardiography to derive a PDA risk score based using a mathematical formula:(Gestation in weeks × -1.304) + (PDA diameter in mm × 0.781) + (Left ventricular output in ml/kg/min × 0.008) + (maximum PDA velocity in m/s × -1.065) + (LV a` wave in cm/s × -0.470) + 41, where 41 is the constant of the formulaInfants with a risk score ≥ 5.0 are deemed to be at high risk of developing CLD/death and will be randomised to either arm.</span>

Patients must also: - Present reactivation or Worsening, or No Further Improvement of the disease for at least 4 weeks from initiation of treatment after having achieved at least Partial or Incomplete Response see definitions in Table 1 OR b. Show No Response for at least 2 weeks from initiation of treatment or Worsening of the disease see definitions in Table 1 OR c. Show Intolerance to conventional treatment of HLH, as judged by the treating physician 3. Diagnosis of primary HLH according to the following criteria as per the HLH-2004 protocol:     a. A molecular diagnosis or familial history consistent with primary HLH,     or     b. Five out of the eight criteria below are fulfilled:         - Fever         - Splenomegaly          - Cytopenias affecting 2 of 3 lineages in the peripheral blood haemoglobin  90 g/L platelet  100 x 109/L neutrophils   1 x 109/L         - Hypertriglyceridemia fasting triglycerides  3 mmol/L or  265 mg/dL and/or hypofibrinogenemia  1.5 g/L         - Haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy         - Low or absent natural killer NK-cell activity          - Ferritin  500 mg/L         - Soluble CD25 sCD25 i.e. soluble IL-2 receptor  2400 U/mL. In case the diagnosis of HLH is based on the 5 of the 8 above criteria and not on a molecular finding or a familial history consistent with primary HLH, the patient is eligible to enter the study if there is a. Reactivation, or Worsening, or No Further Improvement for at least 4 weeks from initiation of treatment of the disease after having achieved at least Partial or Incomplete Response see definitions in Table 1. In this specific situation, Worsening and No Further Improvement must include abnormal sCD25 or ferritin  2000 ng/ml OR a.b. No Response for at least 2 weeks from initiation of treatment or Worsening of the disease without previous Partial or Incomplete Response. Soluble CD25 must be abnormal or ferritin  2000 ng/ml and the evaluation and approval by the Scientific Steering Committee is mandatory see definitions in Table 1 OR b.c. Intolerance to conventional treatment of HLH, as judged by the treating physician and approval by the Scientific Steering Committee is mandatory  4. Patients must have received treatment for HLH according to the conventional therapy at the site e.g. corticosteroids alone or in combination with etoposide, cyclosporin, methotrexate etc.. At the time of enrollment, eligible patients might still be receiving treatment induction or maintenance or might have already discontinued it. 5. Informed consent signed by the patient if  18 years old, or by the patients legal representatives with the assent of patients who are legally capable of providing it. 6. Having received guidance on contraception for both  male and female patients sexually active and having reached puberty: Female of child-bearing potential, having a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, unless true abstinence is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, must agree to use adequate methods of birth control from screening until 6 months after receiving last dose of the study drug. Men with partnerss of child-bearing potential must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering a child from screening until 6 months after receiving last dose of the study drug.</span>

Unless there is an increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to \\&gt; 500 in the following 7 days, bone marrow aspirate should be repeated on day +28. If the white blood count is still less than 200 and bone marrow is acellular, bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donor should be reactivated and availability of cord blood (CB) units assessed. If the BM or PBSC donor is not confirmed within 14 days of the request for the donation (typically second donation from the same donor), CB unit should be used instead.Primary or secondary graft failure after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation defined as a \\&gt; 50% loss of donor chimerism from previous maximum or less than 25% donor beyond day +42 with pancytopenia and no evidence of relapse. Patients with any diagnosis, type of donor, hematopoietic cell graft or conditioning regimen should be considered for this study.* primary graft failure is defined as:  * ANC \\&lt; 500  * BM \\&lt; 10% on two occasions (Day +21 and Day +28)  * Donor chimerism need not to be considered, provided there is no evidence of malignancy* secondary graft failure is defined as \\&lt; 5% cellularity and ANC \\&lt; 500 for more than 7 days any time after primary engraftment).  * Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device \\[IUD\\], surgical sterilization, subcutaneous implants, or abstinence, etc.) for the duration of treatment.  * Patients or their guardian are able and willing to provide written informed consent.Patient</span>
